<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my businesses, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies quoted me with different rates and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again. He is honest, dependable, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to discover a sincere AC guy and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
