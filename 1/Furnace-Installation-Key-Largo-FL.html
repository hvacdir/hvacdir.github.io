<p>Instantaneous discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Exceptional Client Service! Environment Pro is trustworthy and really cared about us and our situation. We got home one evening to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that exact same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could look for and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely appreciative to have a heated house once again. What's most amazing was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right before a holiday, however Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my pals.<p>
