<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
