<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s below package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single see, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance visits annually, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and normally some other advantages.
