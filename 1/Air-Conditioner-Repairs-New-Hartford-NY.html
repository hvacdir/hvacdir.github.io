<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to provide thermal convenience inside. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities generate mold growth and wetness indoors is related to a greater prevalence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
