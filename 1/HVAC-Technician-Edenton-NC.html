<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else might come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to purchase it. My partner stated that she had seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good individuals I have met in a long time.
