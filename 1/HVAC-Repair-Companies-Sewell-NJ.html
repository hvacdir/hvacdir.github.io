<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Often times, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, since the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than buying just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for property owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
