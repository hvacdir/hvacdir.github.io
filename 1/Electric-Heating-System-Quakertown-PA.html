<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
