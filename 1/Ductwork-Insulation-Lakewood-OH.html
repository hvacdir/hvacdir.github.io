<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.

<h3>Things to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Lakewood OH</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and extremely clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
