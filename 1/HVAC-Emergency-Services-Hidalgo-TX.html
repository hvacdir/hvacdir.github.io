That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of wetness from the air, Air conditioners can produce a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
