<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly easy to determine surrogate for indoor pollutants discharged by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high inside your home may cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of co2 in a lot of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
