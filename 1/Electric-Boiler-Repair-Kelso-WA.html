<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw.
