In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " top environmental threat to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of ways in which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how damaging lead might be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
