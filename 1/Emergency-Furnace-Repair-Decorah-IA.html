<p>Great Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved issues. I would recommend this item to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
