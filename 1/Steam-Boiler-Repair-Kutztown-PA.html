Buildings constantly develop as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them along with the residents, products, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a structure are continuously connecting, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we may see a window as altering slightly gradually as it ends up being filthy, then is cleaned, builds up dirt once again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life.
