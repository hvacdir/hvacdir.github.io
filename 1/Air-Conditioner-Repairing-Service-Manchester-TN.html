On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested informing me about our system, and left having resolved the issue with a simple repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He was friendly, simple and a completely satisfying individual to have around that entire time. His time and competence to FIX the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>When trying to figure out how frequently I need to change my air conditioning filters, there are lots of things to take into consideration. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 house has an unique DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about six months of close observation to see how often your a/c filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better best decision on how frequently your HVAC filters need replacing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less typically you'll have to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 houses with only one cooling filter require replacing more frequently.<p>
