<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Stratham NH</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the a/c prior to you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<h3>AC Technician in Stratham NH 03885</h3>

<p>It might feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory issues, winter can exacerbate problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating unit can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your house.

<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are great for those aiming to save money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are generally only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability.

For that reason, this may not be the best option for homeowners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
