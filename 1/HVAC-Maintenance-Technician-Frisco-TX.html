<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
