<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as a Vital Company in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which might be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can indicate substantial cost savings in yearly heating costs. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single check out, or you can sign up for a maintenance plan with your local heating and a/c company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance check outs annually, plus another service call, a discount on parts, and typically some other benefits. Some companies offer priority visits to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
