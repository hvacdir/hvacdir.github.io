<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>Next, and possibly just as essential when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to properly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
