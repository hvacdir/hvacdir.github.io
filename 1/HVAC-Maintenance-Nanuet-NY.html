<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
