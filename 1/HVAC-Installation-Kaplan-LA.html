<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads.
