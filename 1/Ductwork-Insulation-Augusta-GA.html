<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
