<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
