<p>Most people do not understand how humidity is eliminated from your Houston Midtown Tx home. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the wet hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the space that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining effectively, you'll have a water leakage. A constraint in your drain pipes causes a water leakage. There are various locations a clog can take place. One of the main areas where obstructions start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

He is sincere, dependable, and affordable on cost. It's tough to discover a truthful AC person and I'm grateful I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
