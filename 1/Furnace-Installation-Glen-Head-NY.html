<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Glen Head NY 11545</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
