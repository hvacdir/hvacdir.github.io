<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have several control panel. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel must be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
