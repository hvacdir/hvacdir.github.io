The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in more than half the office indoor air investigations it has conducted. Examinations conducted in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the very same to be real. These investigations exposed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in maintaining great indoor air quality.<p>
