<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
