<p>We look at hints before we supply advice to replace instead of repair a heater. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy.

<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is frequently important to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can in some cases be gotten by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent should request that the employer have air monitoring tests carried out. Evaluation of this data might determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data may not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
