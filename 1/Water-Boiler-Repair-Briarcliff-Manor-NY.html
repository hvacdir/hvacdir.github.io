<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends on several elements including age and preexisting medical conditions.

<p>For example, issues arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to generate appropriate amounts of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation also happens if the air supply and return vents within each room are obstructed or placed in such a way that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Incorrectly situated outdoor air intake vents can also bring in air infected with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological impurities that have actually multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>If your a/c unit is more than 8 years old, repair is most likely not worth the expense, unless it's an easy problem like debris obstructing the condenser unit or a used fan belt.
