<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very extensive in explaining what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn offered great customer care at the end of the visit by explaining precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have actually carried out in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale techniques utilized by some in the industry.<p>
<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and cure-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom floor.<p>
