<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may become blocked, decreasing air circulation distribution, quality, and volume.

<p>As pointed out above, activating your brand-new under tile flooring heating unit prematurely, before the mortar has treated, can trigger the grout to break or to not adhere properly, and might void the warranty of your mortar item. In some testing, even the tile split when the system was run prior to the compound had cured. If you do not follow their instructions, and mortar producers may decline guarantee protection.<p>
