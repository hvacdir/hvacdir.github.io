<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
