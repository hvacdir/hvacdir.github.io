<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be residing in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the performance of your heating and a/c system. There are numerous design techniques in usage today; nevertheless, all ground source heat pumps operate with comparable concepts.

<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed.
