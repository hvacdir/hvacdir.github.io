<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

Contaminants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or individual care items. Germs and infections, pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
