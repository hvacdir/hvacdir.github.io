<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>People who dislike these pollutants ought to utilize allergen-proof mattress encasements, wash bed linen in hot (130 degrees farenheit) water, and prevent space furnishings that build up dust, specifically if they can not be cleaned in hot water.
