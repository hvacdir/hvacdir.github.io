<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
