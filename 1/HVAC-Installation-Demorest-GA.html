The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat circulation over the entire surface area of a floor warms the lower half of the space, covering inhabitants in heat at a lower total temperature-- in many cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heater."
