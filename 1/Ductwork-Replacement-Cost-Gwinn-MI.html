<p>Recent Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
