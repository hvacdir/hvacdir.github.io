<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we recommend using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by serving as a very efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of allowing heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after turning on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
