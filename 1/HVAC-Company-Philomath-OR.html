<p>Excellent Product! Delivery was sort of strange being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we dealt with problems.
