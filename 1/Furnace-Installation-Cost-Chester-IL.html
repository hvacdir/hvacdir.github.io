<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
