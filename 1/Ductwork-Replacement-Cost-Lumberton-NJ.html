<p>A routine furnace tune up can take full advantage of effectiveness and supply longer lasting house heating. Nevertheless, there are times when a basic maintenance call can determine an issue that will need a significant investment to treat. Then, it's decision time. Do you make the pricey repair and delight in ongoing convenience from your present heater? Or, do you make an even bigger financial commitment to replacing the furnace? The decision to repair or change is up to you, and often it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, considering the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely offers greater energy performance and features warranty protection.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your car. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear.

During high use months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
