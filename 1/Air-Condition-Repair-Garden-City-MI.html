<p>The possibility of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon several factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences. In other cases, whether a person responds to a toxin depends upon private level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological toxins after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical pollutants too.<p>
<p>Integrity Energy was quick to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two heating systems were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the new heating systems can heat your home.
