<p>Direct Exposure Control: Changing the time and location of contaminant exposure. An example of time control is setting up floor removing and waxing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday.

Place control includes moving the toxin source far from occupants or even moving susceptible occupants.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
