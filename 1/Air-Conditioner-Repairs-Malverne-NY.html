<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, most Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing, then the next action is to defrost your a/c devices. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
