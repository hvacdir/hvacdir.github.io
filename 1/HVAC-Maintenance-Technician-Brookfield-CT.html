<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>

The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
