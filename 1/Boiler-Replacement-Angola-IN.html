<p>The exhaust outlets permit all hazardous gases to escape your property so there's no dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. They can lead to a hazardous build-up and compromise your safety if the exhaust outlets are obstructed. The technician will evaluate all of these aspects of your system and inspect the chimney flue and vent stack as well. They will look for signs of deterioration, leakages, and back draft and repair the issue during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
