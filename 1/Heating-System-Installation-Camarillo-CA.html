The current pattern in home construction is to reduce air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, roofings, and floorings. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor impurities exhaust them from the home.<p>
