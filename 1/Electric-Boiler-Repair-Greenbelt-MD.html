<p>Over the past few years, there has been some promotion suggesting that houseplants have been revealed to minimize levels of some chemicals in lab experiments.

Because overly wet soil may promote the growth of microbes which can impact allergic individuals, indoor houseplants must not be over-watered.<p>
