<h3>Things to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Littleton MA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater. We decided on getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
