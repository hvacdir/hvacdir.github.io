<p>. Prior to selecting the installation location of air conditioning system, a number of main elements require to be considered. To start with, the instructions of air flow from the indoor units must not fall on the place of rest or work area. Second of all, there must not be any barriers en route of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible.

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.

The two operations use various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to accomplish its objectives.<p>
