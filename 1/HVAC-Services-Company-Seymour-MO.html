We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to check the a/c prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
