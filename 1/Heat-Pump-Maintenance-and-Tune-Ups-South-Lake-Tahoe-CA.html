<p>I am a real estate investor, I require to replace two heaters in a 8000square foot house. You can count on us to finish the job right.

<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy.
