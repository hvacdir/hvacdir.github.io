<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.)
