If you have actually installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

However, it is not always real that the impacts kept in mind happen at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the house. In many cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health impacts is too limited to figure out the levels at which the listed impacts could occur.<p>
