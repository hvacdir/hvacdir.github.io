<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.
