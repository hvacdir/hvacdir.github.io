The majority of owners stick with the bigger companies after acquisition. In some cases, the acquisition provides a way for the seller to retire and make certain employees are looked after.

Reedy chooses the owners stay on and reinvest a portion of their equity from the sale back into the company, although this isn't a requirement.<p>

<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion goal.
