(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
