If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>

The sound level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
