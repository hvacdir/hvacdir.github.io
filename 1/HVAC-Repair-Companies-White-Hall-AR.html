HVAC specialists recommend following this standard rule when choosing whether it's worth buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
