<p>. Before choosing the installation area of ac system, several primary elements require to be thought about. To start with, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems should not fall on the place of rest or workspace.

The outside unit should likewise be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be efficiently released outside and the efficiency of the whole system will drop dramatically.
