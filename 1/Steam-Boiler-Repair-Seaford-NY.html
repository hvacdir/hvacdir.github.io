<h3>HVAC System in Seaford NY 11783</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>

<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
