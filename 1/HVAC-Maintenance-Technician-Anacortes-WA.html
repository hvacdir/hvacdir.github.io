One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the floor are forced to withstand current, which then creates heat.<p>
