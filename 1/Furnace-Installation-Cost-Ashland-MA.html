<p>Current Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my needs totally by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing extra products. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also promptly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement attempts to upsell you whenever they concern carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for 7 years, although it was 6 months before the current one expired. She didn't require a air filtering system, however they talked her into it.<p>
