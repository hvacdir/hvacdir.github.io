<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Services in Fraser</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe in addition to the efficiency of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task finding the outside system as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
