Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J computation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor before providing an installation or unit cost for a/c.

Just like determining the size of an unit required based on BTUs, identifying the correct size of unit for your home also depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c are more energy effective than models made 5 years back, so it makes monetary sense to replace or update your unit if it's five years of ages or older.
