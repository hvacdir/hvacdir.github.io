<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

Possibly Realtors should think about a lot of variables to definitively mention what a radiant heat system might add to, or subtract from, any offered asking rate. That said, property buyers looking to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heating unit will be willing to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
