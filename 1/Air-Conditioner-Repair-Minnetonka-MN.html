<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the problem.<p>
