<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
