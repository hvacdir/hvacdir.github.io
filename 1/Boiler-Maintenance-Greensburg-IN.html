<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>

To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator requires dealt with by specialists, go to Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
