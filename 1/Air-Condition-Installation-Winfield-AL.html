<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c unit increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
