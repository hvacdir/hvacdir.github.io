<p>We needed 2 visits - Jake came out first and was extremely well-informed and enjoyable and respectful. Grant came out a couple days later and was likewise educated and nice to speak with.

<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Nick B. provided exceptional, personalized, attentive, and quality service. His communication design is friendly, interesting and effective. He clearly and thoroughly described all issues and fixes in a way that made me confident in his ability to fix my repair problems. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally pick up a required part that was not in stock, ensuring repairs were made so that my partner and I would not need to endure another night without heat, during among the coldest winter seasons in current memory. He also responded to my call right away the next early morning, and coached me through a short-lived repair to a problem that could not be resolved on the very first visit due to not available parts. I trust Nick's skills, experience and capability to provide constant, quality service.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
