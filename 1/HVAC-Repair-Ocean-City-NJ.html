<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
