Toxins might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering your home from the ground below. An air contaminant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or personal care items. Infections and germs, animal dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
