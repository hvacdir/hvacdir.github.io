<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
