<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and place of pollutant exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This enables products to off-gas over the weekend while most of the staff are at house over the weekend. Area control includes moving the contaminant source far from residents and even relocating vulnerable residents.<p>
<p>To be honest, few of the centers supervisors who use our indoor air quality tracking service came to us for that reason. More often than not they were at first interested in remotely keeping track of some other aspect of their buildings, such as energy use, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't till later on, as they continued dealing with us, that they found out about and executed indoor air quality keeping an eye on to provide a healthier, safer structure environment-- and to head off the negative repercussions related to indoor air contaminants.<p>

<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
