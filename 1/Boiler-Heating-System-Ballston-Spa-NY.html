<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get an a/c service plan which usually includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 years of age AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our options did an outstanding task in ensuring we understood the benefits and drawbacks of each choice. The professionals who set up the brand-new system were professional and fast, while requiring time to make certain we comprehended how the new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
