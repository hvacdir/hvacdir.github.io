<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
