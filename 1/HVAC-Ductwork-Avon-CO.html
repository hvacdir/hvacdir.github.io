<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has ended up being an important problem to house owners and health specialists. Indoor air pollution studies have actually identified several impurities that can be present in indoor air.

<p>For example, issues develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate sufficient amounts of outside air. Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or positioned in such a way that outdoor air does not really reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Poorly located outside air consumption vents can also generate air infected with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
