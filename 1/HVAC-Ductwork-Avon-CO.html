Poorly located outside air consumption vents can also generate air infected with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
