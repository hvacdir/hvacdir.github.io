<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent.
