<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
