<p>I generally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
