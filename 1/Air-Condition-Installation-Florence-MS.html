<p>You should constantly employ a professional to carry out AC repair, for the same factor that you trust an expert plumbing or electrical contractor. You do not carry out repairs on your own pipes system, or replace your own electrical grid. The factors that you don't do those things are apparent.

However, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a reputable company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air contaminants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
