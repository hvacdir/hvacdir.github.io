<h3>HVAC Systems Are a Must for All Homes and Offices in Sparta MI</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on different house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to assist us debate which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
