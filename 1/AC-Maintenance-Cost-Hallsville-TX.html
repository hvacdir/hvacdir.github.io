<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
