<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne.
