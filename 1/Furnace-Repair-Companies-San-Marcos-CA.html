<p>If the AC does not turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen in time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay.
