<h3>What to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Norristown PA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We decided on getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our greatest energy expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
