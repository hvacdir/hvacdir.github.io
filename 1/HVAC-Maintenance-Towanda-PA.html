<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
