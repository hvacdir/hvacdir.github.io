<h3>What to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in West Branch MI</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field.

From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
