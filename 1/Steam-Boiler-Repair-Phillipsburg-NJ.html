<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a separate split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, given that a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
