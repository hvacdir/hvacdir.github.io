The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.

It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
