<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who reside in the home. Contaminants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could also come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or moist carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and infections, animal dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
