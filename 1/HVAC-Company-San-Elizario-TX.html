Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
