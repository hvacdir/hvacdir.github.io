<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, houses and workplaces matters, particularly given that we spend most of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in extremely damp environments or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it might not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioning system will require more energy to cool your home. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
