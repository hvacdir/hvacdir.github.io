<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil modification in your vehicle. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
