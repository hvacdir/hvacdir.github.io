<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
