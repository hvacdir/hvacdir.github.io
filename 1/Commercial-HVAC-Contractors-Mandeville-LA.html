<p>Often, indoor air quality issues in large commercial buildings can not be successfully determined or fixed without an extensive structure investigation.

In many cases, these questions may rapidly uncover the problem and on-site sees are unnecessary.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation.

<p>Replacing your old furnace with a new, more effective model can fight volatile energy costs, lowering your heating expenses by up to 45%.
