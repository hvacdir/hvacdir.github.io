<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
