<p>Airflow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Air pressure differences developed by these forces move air-borne toxins from areas of higher pressure to locations of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move until the within pressure is equal to the outside.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works however the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
