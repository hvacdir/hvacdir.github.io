<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Production integrates quality items and exceptional service with development and technological advances to provide high-performance heating & cooling items all over the world. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external system. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioning system there is a more powerful compressor, ports for linking several traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor systems located in the space.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
