<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Think about potential effects of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the maker's instructions, particularly instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater effectively changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is generally a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating unit is in usage, open a door from the room where the heater is located to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
