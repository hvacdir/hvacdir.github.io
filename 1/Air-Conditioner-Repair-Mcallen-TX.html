<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the appointment he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent informing me about our system, and left having resolved the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He got along, uncomplicated and a completely enjoyable individual to have around that entire time. His time and proficiency to SOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a rather unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All things in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
