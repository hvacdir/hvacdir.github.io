<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
