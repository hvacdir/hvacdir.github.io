<h3>Tips To Avoid Furnace Repairing Costs in West Plains MO</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
