<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
