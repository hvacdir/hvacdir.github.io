<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<p>Outdoor contaminants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Experts advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, but higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and generally are better for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

Nevertheless, both systems have a large array of various components for different applications along with a variety of brand name and particular installation requirements.
