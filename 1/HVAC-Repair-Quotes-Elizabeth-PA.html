<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S).

Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>My oldest child constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one.

The noise level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy saving too.<p>
