<p>We take a look at clues prior to we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heater. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be wasting cash by not changing the older system.<p>
