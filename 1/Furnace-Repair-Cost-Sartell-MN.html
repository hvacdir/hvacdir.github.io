<h3>Benefits of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Sartell MN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
