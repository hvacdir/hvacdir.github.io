There have been awkward noises. I got it examined and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. Overall, it has actually been an excellent experience. Reliable on the whole. Neat operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its appearances in the beginning. However then recognized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
