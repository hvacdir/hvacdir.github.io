After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
