<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
