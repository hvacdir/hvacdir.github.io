<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not go beyond the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%.

Simply put, the outside system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not simple, because it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it ends up being damp.<p>
