<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
