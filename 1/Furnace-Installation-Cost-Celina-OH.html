A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
