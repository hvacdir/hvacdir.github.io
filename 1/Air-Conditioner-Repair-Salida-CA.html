<p>A packaged unit, generally installed on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise a choice for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically only offered for larger homes due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for homeowners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
