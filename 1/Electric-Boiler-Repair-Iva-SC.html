<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are managed in a method that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products provide a danger only.
