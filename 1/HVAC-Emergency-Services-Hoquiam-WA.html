<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to offer your home that best temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in pricey repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service strategy which normally consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>No matter what kind of heating unit you have in your home, you can save money and increase your comfort by effectively keeping and upgrading your devices. However keep in mind, an energy-efficient furnace alone will not have as great an impact on your energy bills as using the whole-house approach By combining appropriate equipment maintenance and upgrades with advised insulation, air sealing, and thermostat settings, you can save about 30% on your energy bill while decreasing environmental emissions.<p>
