<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
