<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta provide whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They met my needs completely by offering a professional quote with choices, without pressing additional products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the necessary examinations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
