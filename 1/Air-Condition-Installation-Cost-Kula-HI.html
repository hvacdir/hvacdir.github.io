<p>A geothermal desuperheater is beneficial and really effective, specifically throughout the Summer while the system acts to cool one's house.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
