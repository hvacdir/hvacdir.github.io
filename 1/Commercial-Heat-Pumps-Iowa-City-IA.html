<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
