<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Hernando FL</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality concerns. In the lack of such legislation, the "general duty stipulation" uses. This provision, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, specifies that a company must supply a safe and healthy  office. Therefore, ensuring the air is of excellent quality is the employer's task.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
