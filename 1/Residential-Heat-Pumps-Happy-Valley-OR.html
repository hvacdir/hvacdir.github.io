<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based only on emails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination results look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
