<p>When installing the whole system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Installing one included excavation, running hundreds of lawns of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is rather expensive.

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
