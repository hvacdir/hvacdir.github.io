<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter can exacerbate issues.

In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather it is necessary to be knowledgeable about some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your surroundings.<p>
