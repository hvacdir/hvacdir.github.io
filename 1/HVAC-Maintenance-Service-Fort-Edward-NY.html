<p>There are lots of reasons why this can occur. Fortunately is that you can deal with a number of these elements by yourself without the need to call for professional aid.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and then switch it ON.

<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
