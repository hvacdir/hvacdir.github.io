<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
