<h3>Heating System Repair in New London CT 06320</h3>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
