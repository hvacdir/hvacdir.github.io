<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce pollutants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the two ought to not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water system, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is used for generating power in the form of electricity. The two operations use various processes, with geothermal energy needing water be heated up to boiling point to achieve its goals.<p>
