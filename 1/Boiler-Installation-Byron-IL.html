<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit prior to you purchase.
