<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather substantial.<p>
