<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC industry, Bard Production combines quality items and impressive service with innovation and technological advances to deliver high-performance cooling and heating products all over the world. A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of several rooms with one external system. In the outside unit of this a/c there is a more effective compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for controling the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor units located in the room.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the exact same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking devices will send the sensing unit information to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results via a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>
