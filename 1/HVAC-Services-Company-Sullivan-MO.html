<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air conditioning unit is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy efficient than models made 5 years back, so it makes monetary sense to replace or update your unit if it's 5 years of ages or older. The best central air conditioner you can buy today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one acquired in 1975 while providing the same amount of cooling.<p>
