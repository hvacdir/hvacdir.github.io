The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>Space air conditioning system feature a thermostat sensing unit, situated behind the control board, which determines the temperature level of air coming into the evaporative coil. If the sensing unit is knocked out of position, the air conditioning system might cycle constantly or behave erratically. The sensor should be near the coil but not touching it; adjust its position by carefully flexing the wire that holds it in location.<p>
