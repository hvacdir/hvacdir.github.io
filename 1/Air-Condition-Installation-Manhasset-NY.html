<p>If you work in building, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your pastime involves lead, you might unconsciously bring lead into your house on your hands or clothing. You may likewise be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil very close to homes may be contaminated from lead paint on the outside of the building. Soil by highways and roads might be infected from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet before entering the house. Alter your clothing before you go home and clean these clothes separately if you work with lead in your job or a hobby.
