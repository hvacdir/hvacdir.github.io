In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge contaminants.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home.
