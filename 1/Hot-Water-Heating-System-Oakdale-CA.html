However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to offer thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities trigger mold development and moisture inside is related to a higher frequency of occupant breathing problems.<p>
