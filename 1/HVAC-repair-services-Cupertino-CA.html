They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.
