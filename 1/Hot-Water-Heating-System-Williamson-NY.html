Not only was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized.

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>As a building owner or facility manager, you require to think about the cost of unanticipated downtime and the effect older, ineffective systems have on the bottom line.
