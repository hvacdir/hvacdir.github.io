<p>Award Winning Plumbing and HVAC Services. Many typical building products used prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Usually, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not constantly optimal since the fibers can be spread out into the air during the elimination process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing products is often advised instead.<p>
