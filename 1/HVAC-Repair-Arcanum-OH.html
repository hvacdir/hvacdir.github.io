<h3>Choosing the Right Arcanum OH Company For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require reasonably little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is important to keep the system functioning smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank must be checked for leakages, the system must be flushed regularly to eliminate tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems must be checked at least twice annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to eliminate dust collected in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
