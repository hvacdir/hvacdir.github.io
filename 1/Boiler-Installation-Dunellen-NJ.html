<p>Geographically, some locations pay consistently greater incomes for air conditioning tradesmen. This might be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or simply a high level of competition for knowledgeable trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical salaries for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 per year. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to supply sufficient modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
