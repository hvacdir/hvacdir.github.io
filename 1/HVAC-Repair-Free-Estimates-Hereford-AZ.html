<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the correct temperature level. Heating systems that kick on regularly may be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>

You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results by means of a control panel, which turns the data into visual charts that are easy to figure out.<p>
