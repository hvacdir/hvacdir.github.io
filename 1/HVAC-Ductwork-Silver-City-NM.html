<p>Certain immediate impacts are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often hard to determine if the signs are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is necessary to focus on the time and place the signs occur. If the signs fade or go away when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort must be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some results might be made worse by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, heating, or humidity conditions widespread in the house.<p>
<p>To be sincere, few of the facilities managers who utilize our indoor air quality monitoring service came to us because of that. Generally they were initially interested in from another location monitoring some other element of their buildings, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't up until later, as they continued dealing with us, that they learnt more about and carried out indoor air quality keeping an eye on to offer a healthier, more secure structure environment-- and to avoid the negative effects related to indoor air pollutants.<p>
