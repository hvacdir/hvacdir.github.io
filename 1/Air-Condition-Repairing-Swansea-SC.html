<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>The function of the majority of building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing security at affordable energy expenses. Load calculating is described as the Handbook J computation and ought to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for cooling. If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based upon experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor. Just like determining the size of a system needed based on BTUs, determining the appropriate size of system for your house likewise depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
