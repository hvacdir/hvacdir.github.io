<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Good AC Repair Company in Swanton VT</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
