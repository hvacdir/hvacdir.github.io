Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
