<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan.

When checking your air conditioning equipment to turn off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or detach switch, constantly make sure.

<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Keep Your Paw Paw MI Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater because the professionals believed they just didn't appear right and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
