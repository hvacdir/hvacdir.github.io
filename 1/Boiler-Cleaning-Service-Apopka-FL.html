<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.

Evaluation of this information may identify possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on data might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
