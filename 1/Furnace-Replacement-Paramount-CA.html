<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you must check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
