Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
