<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, work environments and homes matters, especially given that we spend the majority of our lives indoors. A/c help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the air conditioner is extra-large, it might not accomplish a low humidity.

An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
