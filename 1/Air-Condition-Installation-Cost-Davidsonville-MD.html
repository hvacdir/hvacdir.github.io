<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from processes or items; for the many part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently harmless as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include volatile chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These products present a threat only when they are dealt with in a manner that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or disrupted by repair, remodeling, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can become airborne if proper controls are not in place. This can result in the potential for significant illness.<p>
