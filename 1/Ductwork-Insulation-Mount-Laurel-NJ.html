Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is frequently difficult to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided.

If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the component.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
