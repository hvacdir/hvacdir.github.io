It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the patio area where the system sits. I feel like they offer me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
