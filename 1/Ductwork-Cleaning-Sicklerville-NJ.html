<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>
