This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>

I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, most commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy individuals require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
