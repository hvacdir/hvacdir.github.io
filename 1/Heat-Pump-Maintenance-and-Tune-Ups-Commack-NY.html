<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as an automobile radiator or normal family a/c does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
