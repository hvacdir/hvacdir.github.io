<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
