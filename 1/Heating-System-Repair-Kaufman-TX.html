<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the typical house. In addition to making repairs sooner rather than later on, establishing a routine maintenance schedule can assist you get the most out of your HVAC system Our Seattle heating unit repair specialists can examine your system, and let you understand what locations need attention.

<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for efficiency. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost during the combustion procedure. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward procedure. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
