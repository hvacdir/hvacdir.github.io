<p>The first ac system and fridges employed flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<h3>Heating And Cooling Companies in Troy Michigan</h3>
<p>When central air service stops working during a heat spell, you may need to wait days for an HVAC repair technician or an ac contractor to appear, and you'll most likely pay at least a number of hundred for the repair.

<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Troy MI</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner.

We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
