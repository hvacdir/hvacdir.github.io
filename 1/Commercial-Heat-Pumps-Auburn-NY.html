<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for several years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills suddenly appear higher than regular, it is probably time to consider a new system.

<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned frequently, they can end up being blocked with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency.

By comparison, checking and changing a furnace filter can typically be done in simply a few minutes, often without any tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
