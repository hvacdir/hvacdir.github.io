<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. If your air conditioning system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, merely adding refrigerant is not an option. A skilled technician needs to fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and effectiveness of your a/c is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be damaging to the environment.<p>
