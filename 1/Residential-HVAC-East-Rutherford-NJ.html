If your air conditioning system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, merely adding refrigerant is not an option. A skilled technician needs to fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and effectiveness of your a/c is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be damaging to the environment.<p>
