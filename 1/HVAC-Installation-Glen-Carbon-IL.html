If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively uncomplicated procedure. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
