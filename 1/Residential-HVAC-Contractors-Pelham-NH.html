<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
