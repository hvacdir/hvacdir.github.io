<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Derry NH</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>. Prior to picking the installation place of ac system, a number of primary factors require to be considered.
