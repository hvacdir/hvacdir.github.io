<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure.
