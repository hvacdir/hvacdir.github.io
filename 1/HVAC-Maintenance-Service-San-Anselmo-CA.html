<p>The very first air conditioning system and refrigerators employed flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
<h3>HVAC Maintenance Plans in San Anselmo California</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Our group of specialists are NATE-certified. North American Technician Excellence is the only national certification program for HVAC professionals established, operated, and supported by the whole HVAC industry. NATE accreditation tests represent real-world knowledge, ensuring customers receive proper installation and service of all HVAC equipment, conserving time, energy, and lowering cost of operation and ownership.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes likely define the amount (and sometimes quality) of outdoor air that should be continuously supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Briefly increasing ventilation paired with proper usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
