<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network.

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge toxins.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too expensive-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outdoors air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
