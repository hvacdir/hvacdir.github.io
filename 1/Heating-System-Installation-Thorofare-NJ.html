<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets ask for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
