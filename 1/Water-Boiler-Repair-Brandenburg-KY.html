<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house via ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for performance. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
