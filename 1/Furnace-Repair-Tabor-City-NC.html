Much like other types of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling effect. The majority of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
