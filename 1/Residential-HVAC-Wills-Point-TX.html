<p>The majority of respectable HVAC professionals will use free estimates with an in-person service call. Be careful of HVAC contractors who try to give you a free quote over the phone, as it might not properly reflect what they will find when they take a look at the system. Even if there is a charge for the cost estimate, that amount will usually be used toward your balance due, should you decide to work with that contractor.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, many of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales strategies that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
