<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is frequently essential to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can sometimes be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the company. If keeping track of information is not available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air tracking tests conducted. Evaluation of this data might identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information may not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
