<h3>Central Heating Boilers in Claremont CA 91711</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
