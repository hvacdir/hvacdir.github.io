<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated up without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
