<p>If you work in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your pastime involves lead, you might unconsciously bring lead into your home on your hands or clothes.

Soil by roads and highways may be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from vehicles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet before getting in the house. If you work with lead in your task or a hobby, change your clothing before you go home and clean these clothing independently. Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which sticks to toys and fingers. Attempt to keep your children from consuming dirt, and make certain they clean their hands when they come inside.<p>
