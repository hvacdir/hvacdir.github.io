<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is blowing out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still heats to the right temperature.

Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to contact a specialist to repair the unit and examine.<p>
