<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete pieces, we suggest using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by serving as a really efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile instead of enabling heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
