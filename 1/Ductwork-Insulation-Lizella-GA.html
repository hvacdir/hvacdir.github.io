<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtering. From one of the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the home. Toxins might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air pollutant might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or individual care products. Viruses and germs, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>A third way to decide whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, look for signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can suggest your home might not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To identify smells in your home, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether smells are visible.<p>
