<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
