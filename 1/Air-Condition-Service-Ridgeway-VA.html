<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home.

The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, however it is likewise more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
