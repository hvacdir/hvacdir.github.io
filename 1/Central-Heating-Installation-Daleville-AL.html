<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as created. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold development and wetness inside is related to a greater occurrence of resident respiratory issues.<p>
