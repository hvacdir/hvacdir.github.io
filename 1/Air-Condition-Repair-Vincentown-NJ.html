Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the professionals thought they just didn't appear best and they could not leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>

<p>I have been using them for years for my businesses, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he assisted me problem shoot the concern. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Extremely recommend Luis and his company.<p>
