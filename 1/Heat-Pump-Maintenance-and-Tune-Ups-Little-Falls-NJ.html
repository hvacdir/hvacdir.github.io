I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was extremely delighted they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be utilizing them again.<p>
