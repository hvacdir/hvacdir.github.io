<p>House owners might also presume that because a radiant floor heating system can be viewed (and financed) as a house improvement, its installation will immediately raise their home's worth.

In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Worth Report issued by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Magazine. Perhaps Realtors should consider too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system might contribute to, or deduct from, any provided asking price. That stated, homebuyers wanting to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heating unit will want to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>
