<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
