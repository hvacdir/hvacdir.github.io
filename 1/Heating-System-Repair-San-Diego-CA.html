<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in San Diego CA</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math lately, but I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>

<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may notice unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse, talk to your doctor about them. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Ventilation, heating and air Conditioning, and refers to the environment control systems installed in houses or commercial homes. Their task is to move heated or cooled filtered air throughout the building, to keep inhabitants of the structure comfortable. Literally every structure in Columbus or Franklin County, Ohio or the United States has some sort of environment control system set up.<p>
