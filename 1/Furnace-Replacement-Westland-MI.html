<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
