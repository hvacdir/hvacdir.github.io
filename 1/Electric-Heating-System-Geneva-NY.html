<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
