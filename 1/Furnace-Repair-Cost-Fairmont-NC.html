In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school structures.<p>
