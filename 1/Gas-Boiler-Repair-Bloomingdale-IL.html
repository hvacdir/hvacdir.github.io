Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product with time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
