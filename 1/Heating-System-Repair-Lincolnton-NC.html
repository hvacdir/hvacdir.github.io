Just like other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result. The majority of ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heatpump, around 3 to 5 units are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
