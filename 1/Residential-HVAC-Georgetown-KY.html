<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Georgetown KY?</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
