<p>We take a look at clues before we provide guidance to replace instead of repair a heater. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater every year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline irritant could cause an asthma attack in individuals with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have feline allergies.<p>
