Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>

For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
