<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>While radon in water is not a problem in houses served by most public water products, it has been found in well water. If you have actually checked the air in your home and discovered a radon issue, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory licensed to measure radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot beside the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
