<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
