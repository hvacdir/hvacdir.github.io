<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Service in Ashland</h2>

<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
