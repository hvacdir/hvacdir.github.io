Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years earlier and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
