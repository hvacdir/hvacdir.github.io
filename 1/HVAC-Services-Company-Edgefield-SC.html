<h3>Facts That You Might Not Know About a Boiler Heating System in Edgefield SC</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
