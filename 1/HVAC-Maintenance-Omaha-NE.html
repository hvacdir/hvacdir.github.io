<p>The first a/c unit and refrigerators used combustible or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>It's not suggested for uncertified people to check & repair cooling & HVAC devices. There is a threat of electric shock & death if not properly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups.

When inspecting your air conditioning equipment to turn off all primary power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch, constantly make sure.
