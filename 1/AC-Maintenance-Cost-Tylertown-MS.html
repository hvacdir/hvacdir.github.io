<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
