<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
