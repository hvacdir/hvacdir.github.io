<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that best temperature level throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing some of those typical air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the road. So, make sure to alter your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service strategy which typically includes a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by people and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can become air-borne when it dries. Infected central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
