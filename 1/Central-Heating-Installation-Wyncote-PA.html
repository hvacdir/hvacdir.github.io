<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the go to. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
