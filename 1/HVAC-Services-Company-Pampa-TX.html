<p>Before you go out and purchase an air conditioning unit, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning system? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How large should the ac system be? Too large and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c unit and reduce its life. Too little and your ac system won't have the ability to cool your home properly. When going shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are simply a few of the elements that you need to take into account. Each choice can and will significantly impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't afford to overlook any of them.<p>
<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, much of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
