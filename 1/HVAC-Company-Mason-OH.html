These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency ranked according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE OFFICER). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system produces or removes (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to create the heating or cooling effect. Many ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0.
