<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and may trigger countless nonasth-matic children to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers throat, nose, and eye inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest discomfort.

Irritants discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become airborne, and hence, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks.

While an area heating unit remains in usage, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the rest of the home and open a window a little.<p>
