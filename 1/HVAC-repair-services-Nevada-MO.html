<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a customer you require to be well informed in order not to be totally made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
