<p>G&S did an outstanding task installing our new furnace and AC unit. The best aspect of G&S is that they service warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers guarantee would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they identified the problem and repaired really rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The guidelines that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the exact same. When the wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to properly cure and solidify-- normally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>As many of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is frequently tough to quantify, as one response specified the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of recurring use of a component that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and triggering early degeneration, leading to cracks and holes. , if that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.. a really useful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
