<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might observe unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak with your doctor about them.
