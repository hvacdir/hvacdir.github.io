The standards do not require you to change your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services need to still be readily available for your house's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioning conditioner has to do with 15 to twenty years. Manufacturers typically continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new standard goes into result.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>
