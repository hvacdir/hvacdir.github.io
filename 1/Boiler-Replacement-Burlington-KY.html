Heating systems that kick on often might be because of a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
