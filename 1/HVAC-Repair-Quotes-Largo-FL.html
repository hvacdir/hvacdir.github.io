Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
