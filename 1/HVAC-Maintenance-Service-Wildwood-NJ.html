<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you should look out for. First, you should check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
