When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable influence on occupants-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
