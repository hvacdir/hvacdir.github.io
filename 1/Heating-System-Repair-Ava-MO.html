<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
