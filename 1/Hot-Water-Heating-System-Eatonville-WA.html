<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits.
