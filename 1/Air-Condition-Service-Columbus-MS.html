<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Columbus MS?</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math lately, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding sounds. Though a lot of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. Squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler usually happen when the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips. Most of the times, the belt is poorly aligned or used and requires replacement. Follow the guidelines above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's handbook.<p>
