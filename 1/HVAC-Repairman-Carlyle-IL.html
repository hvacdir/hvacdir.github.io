Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation.
