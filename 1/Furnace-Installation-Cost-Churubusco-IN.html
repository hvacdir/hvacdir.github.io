Since they are called to buildings without functioning climate control, they are likewise subject to the extreme hot or cold temperature levels existing inside an area.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately.
