<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, rather than outdoor or industrial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to individual spaces.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
