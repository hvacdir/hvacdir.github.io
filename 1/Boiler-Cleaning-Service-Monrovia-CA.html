There are many different places an obstruction can occur. Among the main areas where obstructions begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's more than likely your issue. The next step is to thaw your air conditioning devices if you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The easiest method to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
