<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
