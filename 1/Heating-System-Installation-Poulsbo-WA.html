Second of all, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable wetness barrier is set up prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being wet, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of.<p>
