<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
