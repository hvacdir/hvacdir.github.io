<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely handy in collecting details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and offered clear interaction about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.
