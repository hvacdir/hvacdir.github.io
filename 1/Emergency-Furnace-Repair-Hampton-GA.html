<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungis, germs, and very small particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if needed, update the structure envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation might be a more efficient solution to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>A specialized a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard air conditioner because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air course.
