<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
