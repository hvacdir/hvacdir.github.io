<p>One of the downsides of central heating is that it's potentially pricey to set up, specifically in an older home. Depending on the kind of system set up, it can be noisy and cause problems if you're highly adverse dust. Furthermore, certain fuels and equipment might require special authorizations, and there is minimal versatility in the event of changed heating requirements. During usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the home.<p>
