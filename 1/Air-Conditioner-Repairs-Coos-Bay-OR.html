There are numerous design approaches in usage today; however, all ground source heat pumps run with similar principles.

These different heat sources likewise dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
