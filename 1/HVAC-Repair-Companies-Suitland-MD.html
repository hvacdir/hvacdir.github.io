<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at specific danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
