<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can make the most of efficiency and supply longer lasting home heating. However, there are times when an easy maintenance call can recognize an issue that will need a significant financial investment to remedy. Then, it's decision time. Do you make the costly repair and enjoy continued convenience from your present heater? Or, do you make an even bigger monetary commitment to changing the furnace? The choice to change or repair depends on you, and frequently it refers comparing the cost to repair, taking into account the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a brand-new furnace that likely provides greater energy efficiency and includes guarantee coverage.<p>

<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them again. Shut off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the a/c service still does not work correctly after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work fully unless you do this.<p>
