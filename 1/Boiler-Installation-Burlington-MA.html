<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They include hold-ups in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Children, infants, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead. Children might have greater exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in location. In addition, the concrete results of a PM is typically hard to measure, as one response stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of recurring use of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, leading to holes and fractures. , if that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.. a very beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
