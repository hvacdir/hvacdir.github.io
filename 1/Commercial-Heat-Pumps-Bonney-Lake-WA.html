<p>The function of many building ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing safety at affordable energy expenses. Load determining is described as the Manual J estimation and must be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or system cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone. As with determining the size of an unit required based on BTUs, identifying the right size of system for your house likewise depends on the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
