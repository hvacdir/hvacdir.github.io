<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Henderson KY?</h3>
<p>The rest of the HVAC system likewise needs to be in leading condition for the a/c to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the house. If the specific parts are in appropriate order, the technician can take a look at the ductwork for indications of holes, spaces or excessive dirt. Sealing leaks in ductwork can enhance HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler house in the hot summertime.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
