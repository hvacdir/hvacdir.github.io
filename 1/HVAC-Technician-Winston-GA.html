<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the problem.<p>
