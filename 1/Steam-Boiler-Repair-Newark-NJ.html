<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was kind of weird being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we dealt with concerns. I would recommend this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the first time.
