<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines installed under the flooring or right within the floor surface itself.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
