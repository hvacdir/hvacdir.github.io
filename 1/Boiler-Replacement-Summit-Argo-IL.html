<p>We look at ideas before we supply suggestions to replace rather than repair a heating unit. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we understand the unit is not running efficiently. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
