All of the current heaters are much more energy-efficient than those set up even twenty years back.

<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do.

Likewise, clean ducts and proper air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the necessary devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician check the system regularly.<p>
