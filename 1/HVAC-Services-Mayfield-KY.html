Proper ventilation and elimination of the sources of these contaminants are important in maintaining excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each space in the home, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the method is described as radiant heat.<p>
