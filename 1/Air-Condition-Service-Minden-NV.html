<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. supplied extraordinary, customized, mindful, and quality service. His communication design is friendly, appealing and efficient. He clearly and completely discussed all problems and repairs in a way that made me positive in his ability to solve my repair issues. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my partner and I would not need to sustain another night without heat, during among the coldest winters in current memory. He likewise reacted to my call immediately the next morning, and coached me through a short-term repair to a problem that couldn't be fixed on the very first check out due to not available parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and capability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
