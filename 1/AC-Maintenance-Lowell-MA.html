<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " top environmental risk to the health of children in the United States." There are numerous ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. When a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead gets in the body. Prior to it was understood how damaging lead might be, it was utilized in paint, gasoline, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items present a danger only when they are managed in a manner that develops dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing products are harmed or interrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being air-borne if appropriate controls are not in place. This can result in the capacity for significant health problems.<p>
