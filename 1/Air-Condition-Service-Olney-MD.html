<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant.

There are numerous methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Prior to it was understood how damaging lead could be, it was utilized in paint, fuel, water pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
