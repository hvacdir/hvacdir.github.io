Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space.

As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
