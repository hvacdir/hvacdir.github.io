<p>Filters can get dirty quickly, particularly if you live in a location that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, bacteria, and clean the air. They're responsible for keeping the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed frequently, your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you expect it to.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
