The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the taken in heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

<p>The predominant health result related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
