<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the exact same. Once the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly treat and harden-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
