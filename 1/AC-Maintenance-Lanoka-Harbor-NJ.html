<p>We contacted Elite A/C on one of the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to assess circumstance & decided to choose them for the work. I am happy to say that not just did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked to from beginning to end were really professional, considerate and the work was very efficiently done. I would extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>Trane central air conditioners are understood for maintaining warranties and provides a basic 10-year service warranty that covers both parts and labor. A Trane XR14 that has a 14 SEER score in energy efficiency would cost anywhere from $4,800 to $6,800 to set up.
