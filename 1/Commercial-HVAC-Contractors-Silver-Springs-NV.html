Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living.

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
