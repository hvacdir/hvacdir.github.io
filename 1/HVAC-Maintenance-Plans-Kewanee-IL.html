<p>Indoor air pollution is triggered by burning strong fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complex and can differ substantially from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is various from the last. Every maintenance job may need absolutely different actions and procedures than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being examined.

In some cases, completely new ductwork might need to be installed in a structure that had none prior to.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are less common now than gas, but they can be useful in more remote regions where utilities are harder to access, and in colder climates due to the fact that it offers more heat per BTU than other solutions.

<p>Lots of HVAC entrepreneur don't realize they need various prices plans for various services that their company provides. For example, residential HVAC installation ought to be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service need to be priced differently from duct cleaning.

<p>Outside contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers.

<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not offer them..
