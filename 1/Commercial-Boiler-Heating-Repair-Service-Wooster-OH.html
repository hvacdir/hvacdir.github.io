<h3>Finding Best HVAC Contractors in Wooster OH</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
