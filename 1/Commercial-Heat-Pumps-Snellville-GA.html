<h3>Advantages of Professional AC Repair in Snellville GA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your home. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
