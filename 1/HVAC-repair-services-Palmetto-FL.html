<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed.
