<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of people who live in the house. Toxins could come from outside the home-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in a connected garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering the house from the ground below. An air toxin could also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care products. Infections and bacteria, animal dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, ceiling, wall, and floor coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and must be disposed of. In some cases there is a musty odor however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in concealed or hardly ever accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic.

Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
