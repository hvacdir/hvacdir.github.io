Virtually all hydronic radiant floor heat systems today use 1/2 inch diameter plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
