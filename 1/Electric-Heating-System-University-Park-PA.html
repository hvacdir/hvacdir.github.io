<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain poisonous compounds (mycotoxins). Nevertheless, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores. The primary hazard of mold growth, as it relates to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall.

Throughout high use months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
