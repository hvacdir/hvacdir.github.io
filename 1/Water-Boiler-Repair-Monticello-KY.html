The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most inexpensive if your home or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
