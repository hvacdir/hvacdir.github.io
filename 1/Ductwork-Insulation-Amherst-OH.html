<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Amherst OH</h3>
<p>For whole home setups, it's challenging, if nearly difficult, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing house, specifically a hydronic system. Localized glowing floor heat systems to be used in one or a number of rooms like bathrooms, cooking areas or laundry rooms are quickly remodelled with electric radiant floor heat. This is much more cost-efficient on a smaller scale. Larger remodellings like additions to a house may be suitable for a bigger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
