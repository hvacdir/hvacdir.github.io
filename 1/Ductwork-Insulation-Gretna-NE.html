<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily deal with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
