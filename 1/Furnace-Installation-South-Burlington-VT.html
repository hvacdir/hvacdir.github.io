<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
