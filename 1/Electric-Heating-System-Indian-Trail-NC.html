<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building and construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
