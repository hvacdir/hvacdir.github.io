<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<p>Even more recent heaters less than 5 years of ages have been discovered as bad. Too many homeowners are stunned to find out that their 'brand-new' furnace  heat exchanger. Sometimes it is because of poor furnace design, but oftentimes, it's from neglect.

The Efficiency Check-Up (see previous response above) is also crucial to your furnace's life span.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a reference later). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4).

The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight.
