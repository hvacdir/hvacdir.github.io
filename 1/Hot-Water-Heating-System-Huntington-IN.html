<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes.
