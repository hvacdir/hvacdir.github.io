I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
