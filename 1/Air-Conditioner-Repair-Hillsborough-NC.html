<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
