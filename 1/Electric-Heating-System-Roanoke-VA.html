<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outdoors air should be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
