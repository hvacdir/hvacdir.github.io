<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other locations.<p>
