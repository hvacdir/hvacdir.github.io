<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his staff members, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a service was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
