<p>It's not advised for uncertified people to examine & repair a/c & HVAC devices. There is a danger of electric shock & death if not properly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. If you left it to a skilled ac repair Houston Midtown tech for correct HVAC medical diagnosis, it would be best.

The heatpump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
