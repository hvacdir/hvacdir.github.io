<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end objective. HVAC entrepreneur must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
