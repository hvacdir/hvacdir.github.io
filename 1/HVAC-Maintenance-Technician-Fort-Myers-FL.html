<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
