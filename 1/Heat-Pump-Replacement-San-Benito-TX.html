<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in San Benito TX?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater since the specialists believed they just didn't seem ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
