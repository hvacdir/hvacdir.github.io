HVAC professionals advise following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
