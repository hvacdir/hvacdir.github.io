<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room.

<p>Air flow patterns in structure are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure differences developed by these forces move air-borne contaminants from areas of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move till the inside pressure amounts to the exterior.<p>
<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can accumulate and remain in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be fatal).
