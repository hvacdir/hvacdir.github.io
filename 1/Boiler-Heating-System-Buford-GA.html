Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics lately, but I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
