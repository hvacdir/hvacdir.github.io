<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceedingly unusual now.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil.
