<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases produce pollutants.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
