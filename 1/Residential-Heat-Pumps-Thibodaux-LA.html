<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
