<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really consume no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.
