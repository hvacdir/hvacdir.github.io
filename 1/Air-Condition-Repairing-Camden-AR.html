Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
