<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC.
