<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have multiple control boards. The largest, or only one in some heaters, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
