<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue. Ron had found the difficulty area in looking over the expense. He solved the issue in one day, had changed the costs to what I considered fair prior to he called back, knew what may have triggered the problem and had a strategy to guarantee that it would not happen again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
