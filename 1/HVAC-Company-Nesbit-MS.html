The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 each year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year.

Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
