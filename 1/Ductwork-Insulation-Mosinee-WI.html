<p>I generally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m truly fussy with my things. I like my equipment and home appliances initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with low-cost knock-offs. So purchasing this air conditioning unit to change my old one was somewhat of a challenging reality. You canâ $ t trust the commercial nowadays. Am delighted I got this though because it has actually restored my faith in excellent manufacturing. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this brand-new Carrier I got considering that I bought it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s simply best.<p>
