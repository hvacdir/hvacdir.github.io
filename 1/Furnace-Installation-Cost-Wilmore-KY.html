This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the home. The technician can take a look at the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or excessive dirt if the specific parts are in proper order. Sealing leaks in ductwork can enhance HVAC efficiency by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler home in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
