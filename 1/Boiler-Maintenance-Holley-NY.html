This is normally used in a third-floor or 2nd area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
