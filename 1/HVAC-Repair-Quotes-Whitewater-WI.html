<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than industrial or outside settings. In tasks where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

Direct exposure to radon ends up being a concern when radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and structures develop up inside.<p>
