<p>Occupational exposure limitations utilize dose-response information which reveal the health effects of repeated direct exposure to one particular chemical.

Maybe Realtors should think about a lot of variables to definitively state what a radiant heat system might add to, or subtract from, any offered asking cost. That said, homebuyers wanting to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heating system will be willing to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>
