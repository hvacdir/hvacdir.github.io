<p>Today's home convected heat systems take full advantage of infrared radiation. Without a doubt, the most common source of a radiator in a house is the flooring mass. Radiators can be locally situated in one area like a bathroom flooring or be installed across the whole sub-surface of the house's floors. Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heaters-- although ceiling radiators are often used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>Immediate effects may show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate effects are treatable and normally short-term. Sometimes the treatment is just eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also show up soon after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
