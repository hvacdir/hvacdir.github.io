<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed property owners.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to supply enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
