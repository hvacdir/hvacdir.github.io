<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Thomasville GA</h3>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular threat from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Irritants are materials that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become air-borne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline allergen might cause an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those processes include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
