<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Jacksonville IL Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil. This indicates that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
