<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>A/c can produce a great deal of water because they remove wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see Ac system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Asthmatic children are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in numerous thousands of asthmatic children, and might cause countless nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes eye, throat, and nose inflammation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually linked direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Allergens found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these materials are little particles, can become airborne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline irritant could cause an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
