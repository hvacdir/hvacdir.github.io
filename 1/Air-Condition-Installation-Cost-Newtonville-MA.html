<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too.

<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, a professional service person need to be required almost any maintenance aside from routine cleaning.
