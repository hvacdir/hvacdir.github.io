<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer season.

This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>

<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outside particulates can be drawn inside.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air.

Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>

Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.
