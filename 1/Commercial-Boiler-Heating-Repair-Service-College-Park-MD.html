<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ problem. Your company ought to check measurements of air, humidity and temperature flow.

Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofings and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with fungis or germs and need to be removed, also.

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system.

When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
