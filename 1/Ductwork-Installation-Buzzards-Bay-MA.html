<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it pertains to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
