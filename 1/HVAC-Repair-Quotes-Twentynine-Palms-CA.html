<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The primary health effect associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
