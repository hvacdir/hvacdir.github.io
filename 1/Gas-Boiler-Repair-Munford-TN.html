<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated often, and outside measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
