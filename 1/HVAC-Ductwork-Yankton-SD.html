<p>Today, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold may be living in your house's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and cooling system. There are numerous style methods in usage today; however, all ground source heat pumps operate with similar principles. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also dictate the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat utilizing a closed loop.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating components installed in the subfloor of each space in the house, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
