<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads.
