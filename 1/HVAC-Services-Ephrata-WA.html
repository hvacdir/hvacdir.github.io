<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, humans exhale carbon dioxide, which in little quantities is not harmful, but might become harmful if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate. Micro-organisms or germs may also be present within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do establish, they might spread throughout the entire work environment or building by means of the ventilation system.<p>
