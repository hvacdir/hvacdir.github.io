These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
