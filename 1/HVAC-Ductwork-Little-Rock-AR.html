<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are categorized as an Essential Company in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are ranked 90% performance or better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or higher capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>

<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the job based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex correctly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it changed (also Carrier).<p>
