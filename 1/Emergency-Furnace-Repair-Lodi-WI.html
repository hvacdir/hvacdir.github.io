<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent building management.<p>
