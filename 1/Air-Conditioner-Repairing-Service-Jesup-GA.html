<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
