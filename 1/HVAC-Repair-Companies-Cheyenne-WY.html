<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Company in Los Angeles. Switched to using Wachoff's about a year ago and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up three times now.

<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating elements set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
