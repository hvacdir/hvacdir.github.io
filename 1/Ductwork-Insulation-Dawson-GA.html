<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated delay functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature, and the system does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI certification know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as just one component (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, try to find indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can suggest your home might not have enough ventilation include wetness condensation on windows or walls, stuffy or smelly air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To identify smells in your house, action outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to provide adequate changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
