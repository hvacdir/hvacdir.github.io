<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for performance.

If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively simple procedure. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>
