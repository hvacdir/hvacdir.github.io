<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
