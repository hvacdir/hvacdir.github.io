<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
