<p>Although commercial geothermal systems have been in existence considering that the mid-90s, and the concept established much earlier than that, its application in homes is still reasonably new.

<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to also be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, citizens should be alert to the development of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization measures ought to not be carried out till these problems have been corrected.<p>
<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, given that it is protected indoors. When it does require to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to work.<p>

By selecting a central AC system that has as high of an efficiency rating as possible, you can reduce your carbon footprint and save money in the long run.

A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and assisted living home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
