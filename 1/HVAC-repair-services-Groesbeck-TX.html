<p>Use experts and treat them well: Motivated, well-compensated professionals carry out much better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. Because they're low-cost, an ethical company does not make use of inexpensive labor opportunities simply. Inexpensive workmanship is usually shoddy craftsmanship, and it never helps a company develop long-lasting relationships with customers.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but lots of use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better service. If the present system has not incurred other significant repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be determined and fixed, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 2 days might become a source for mold growth and must be disposed of. In some cases there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in covert or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the area using established health department recommendations.<p>
