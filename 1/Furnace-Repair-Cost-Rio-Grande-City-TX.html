<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are used to seeing this enter the yards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts also. Split systems are ideal for cooling several spaces simultaneously, however are not very energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the house.

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
