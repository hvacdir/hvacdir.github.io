<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company in Boring OR</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
