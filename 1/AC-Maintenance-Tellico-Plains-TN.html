<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil change in your car. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, check the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
