<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a properly sized system. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it merely takes more electrical power to run a larger system. And an oversize system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
