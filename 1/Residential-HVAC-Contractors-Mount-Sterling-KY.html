<p>Pollutants such as cooking odors, family pet dander, mold, cigarette smoke, and chemical doors may impact indoor air quality and harmful health impacts may be created that can threaten residents. If members of your household are experiencing particular symptoms such as frequent allergic reactions, other or cold respiratory problems in the house, then it's time for these to be attended to and for your home's indoor air quality to be improved.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up just a few years earlier.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioner works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
