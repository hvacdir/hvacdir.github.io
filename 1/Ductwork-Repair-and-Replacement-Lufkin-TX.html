He dedicated to the job based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few reasonable ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up examination results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
