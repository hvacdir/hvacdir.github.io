<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC unit than a smaller sized home, which will affect installation costs. Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfy. Other aspects that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner in Weirton WV</h3>
