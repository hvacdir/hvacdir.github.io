<h3>Furnace Installation Cost in East Chicago IN 46312</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
