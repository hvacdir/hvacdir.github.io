<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
