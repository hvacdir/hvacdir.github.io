<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me problem shoot the problem when I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is sincere, reputable, and sensible on price. It's hard to discover a truthful AC guy and I'm thankful I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
