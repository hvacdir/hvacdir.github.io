Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>

While there aren't lots of repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system operating at peak effectiveness.<p>
