Many typical building products utilized prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Normally, considerable releases of asbestos fiber do not occur unless the building materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure remodelling.

A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is frequently recommended instead.<p>
