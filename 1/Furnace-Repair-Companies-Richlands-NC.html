<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for several years.

If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting, setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
