<p>I am an investor, I need to replace two heaters in a 8000square foot house. Some sources, such as developing materials, furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release pollutants basically continuously. Other sources, related to activities like smoking cigarettes, cleaning, remodeling or doing hobblies launch contaminants periodically. Unvented or malfunctioning appliances or improperly used items can launch greater and in some cases hazardous levels of contaminants inside.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions because they don't need any new ductwork to be installed. Since a system is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
