<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water at Humble TX</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit need fairly little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is important to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and tank need to be looked for leaks, the system needs to be flushed periodically to eliminate tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems must be inspected a minimum of twice per year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to eliminate dust collected in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
