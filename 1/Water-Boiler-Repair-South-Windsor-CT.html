<p>One of the downsides of central heating is that it's potentially costly to install, especially in an older house. Depending on the type of system set up, it can be noisy and cause problems if you're extremely adverse dust.

<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness needs to go someplace. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just asking for mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri.
