The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.
