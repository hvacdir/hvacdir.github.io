<p>Circuit Board Replacement: Ã¢ $ " Ã A lot of heating systems have several control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control panel must be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonÃ¢ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnÃ¢ $ t correctly identified, changing a board wonÃ¢ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. ItÃ¢ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
