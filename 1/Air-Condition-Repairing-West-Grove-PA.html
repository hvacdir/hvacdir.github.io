<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install examination results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools better than the 13 years of age 4 load R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>I highly recommend utilizing this service. Really dependable incredibly good. Took care of a part that was not covered under guarantee quickly and effective and did not need to pay a leg and an arm to get it done.

I am currently on the maintance plan. He looks after it twice a year with out having to be reminded to do it.<p>
