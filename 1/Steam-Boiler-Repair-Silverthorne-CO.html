<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more difficulties, given that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
