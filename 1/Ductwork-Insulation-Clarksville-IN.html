<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
