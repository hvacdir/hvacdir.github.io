<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home construction is to reduce air leak through fractures and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofing systems. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>

<h3>Boiler Replacement in Bellevue WA 98006</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Though it might be tough to think, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for reducing the air quality in your home, but there are lots of other contaminants that can not only dirty up the air, but result in other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building materials contribute to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (volatile organic substances) from paint and even from some sort of carpeting and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>I am very pleased with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation many years back and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
