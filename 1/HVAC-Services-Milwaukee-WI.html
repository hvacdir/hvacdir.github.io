<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
