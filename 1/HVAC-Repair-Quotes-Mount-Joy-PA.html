<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older homes, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, electrical energy or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific rooms. All-electric boilers can attain approximately 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers need to achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough task that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay.
