<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it could flatter two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed simply a couple of years back.<p>

Look for the ENERGY STAR ® and EnergyGuide labels - qualified central systems are about 15% more efficient than standard models. New residential central air conditioner requirements went into impact on January 1, 2015; see the effectiveness requirements for central air conditioners for information, and consider buying a system with a greater SEER than the minimum for higher savings.<p>
