<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>When you buy a brand-new cooling and heating system, you're buying your house, your household, and your service.
