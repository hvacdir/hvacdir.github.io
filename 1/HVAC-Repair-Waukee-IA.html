Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated home again. What's most fantastic was that this all taken place throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right before a holiday, however Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This enables them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like an area heating system) with the exact same amount of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates.

<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most effective heating sources in terms of ecological expenses. It secures the environment from harmful digging, fracking, or pollutants due to the fact that the energy used to heat your home is extracted directly from the ground. Geothermal systems use compressor and evaporator systems similar to those utilized in refrigerators. While geothermal systems do use some electrical power, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating systems that require natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
