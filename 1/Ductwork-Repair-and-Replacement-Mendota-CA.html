<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the flooring. All wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entrance of the room they are heating, near the light switches.

<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant equipment maker's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in location.

If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the component.  a very beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
