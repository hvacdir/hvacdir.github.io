<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Haslett MI</h3>
<p>I have been using Waychoff for about ten years. Initially, they fixed a bad installation from a previous company. Thereafter, they have kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are extremely experienced and expert. Expenses are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a brand-new air handler and condenser this week. Because the cost was obviously affordable, I did not trouble to get competitor's quotes because of my rely on Waychoff.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils won't produce heat efficiently and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work till you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
