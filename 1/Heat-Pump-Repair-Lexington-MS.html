<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is usually greater than numerous heatpump options, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the model you purchase. One of the main benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating alternatives.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
