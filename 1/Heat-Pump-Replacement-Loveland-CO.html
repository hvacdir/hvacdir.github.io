<p>A health questionnaire must be established and dispersed to all worried employees. Such a tool must identify the number of individuals affected; define ages and job descriptions of involved employees; determine where they lie within the office; suggest when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and time of year); supply a list of specific health signs or health problems; recognize all makers operated in the work environment; show the type of outdoors air pollution; and determine potential sources of task stress.<p>
<p>Through normal use and the unit's presence outside, the coils and fins of the ac system may end up being extremely filthy. These aspects of the equipment are crucial for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans up all elements, and examines connections to guarantee they are secure. The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic elements are examineded for correct function and overall condition. This is an exceptional opportunity to recognize parts that are worn or malfunctioning. Replacing them to repair the a/c might be a lot cheaper when the problem is relatively small.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for indications of problems with the ventilation in your house.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The objective is to provide enough changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
