Search for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>An AC unit maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single go to, or you can sign up for a maintenance strategy with your local heating and cooling company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get a couple of maintenance sees annually, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and generally some other advantages. Some companies offer top priority visits to their maintenance strategy members.<p>
