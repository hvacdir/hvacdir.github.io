<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
