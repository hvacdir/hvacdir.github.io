<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been stressed out from use.

Heaters that kick on often may be due to a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>

Preventive measures consist of adjusting normal hot water levels to allow for 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, examining facility style layout, eliminating faucet aerators, and regular testing in suspect locations.<p>
