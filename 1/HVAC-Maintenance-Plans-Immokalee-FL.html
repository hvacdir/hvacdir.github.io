However according to a cybersecurity professional at a large retailer who asked not to be called due to the fact that he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that consistently keeps track of energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save money on expenses (especially during the night) and to alert shop managers if temperatures in the shops fluctuate outside of an appropriate range that might avoid clients from shopping at the shop.<p>
