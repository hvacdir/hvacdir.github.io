Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil.

Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
