Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem.
