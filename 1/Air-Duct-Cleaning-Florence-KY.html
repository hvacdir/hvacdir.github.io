<p>Regular maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that feature owning a high-demand, seasonal company. A thoroughly crafted service plan for an HVAC company is the primary step to manage those peaks and lulls so your profits stay healthy year-round.

<p>A stopped up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common reason for furnace issues.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
