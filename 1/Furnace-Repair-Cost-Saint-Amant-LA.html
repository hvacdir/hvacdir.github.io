<h3>AC Technician in Saint Amant Louisiana</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>To be sincere, few of the facilities managers who use our indoor air quality tracking service pertained to us because of that.

It wasn't till later on, as they continued dealing with us, that they discovered and carried out indoor air quality keeping track of to supply a much healthier, safer structure environment-- and to head off the negative consequences related to indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
