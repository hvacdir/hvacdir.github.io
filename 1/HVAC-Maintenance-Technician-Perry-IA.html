<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs between $300 to $500 usually.
