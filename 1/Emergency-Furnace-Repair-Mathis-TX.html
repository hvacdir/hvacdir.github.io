<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
