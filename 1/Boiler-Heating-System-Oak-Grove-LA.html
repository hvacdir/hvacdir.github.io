<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act just like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. If your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Employ specialists and treat them well: Encouraged, well-compensated specialists carry out much better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.

Considering bigger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
