<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your a/c unit is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Simply adding refrigerant is not a service if it leakages. A qualified technician needs to repair any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the efficiency and performance of your air conditioning system is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards normally total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary price of a system competitive with conventional equipment. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per lots of heating or cooling capacity, during new construction (houses usually utilize between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the price is getting closer to conventional systems under the best conditions.<p>
