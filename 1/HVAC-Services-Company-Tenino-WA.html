The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Do not worry! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it simply may need 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat needs 24 volts of low voltage supplied by your transformer to keep the digital screen on. You'll get a blank screen if 24 volts isn't gotten. There are various reasons your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be talking about why you might be having difficulty with your Nest wise thermostat. Inspect your emergency breakers initially. You should have the correct amount of high voltage going to your furnace. If you have the proper 120 volts of power going to the furnace, inspect. In some cases the furnace switch is unintentionally turned off by somebody going up in the attic. There is a furnace switch that sometimes goes faulty. It looks like a light switch in the attic.
