<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
