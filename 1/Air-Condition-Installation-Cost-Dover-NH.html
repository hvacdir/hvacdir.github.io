<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in Dover New Hampshire</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>If you have a large house, a home with high ceilings, a house with lots of windows or a home with insufficient insulation, heating your floorings instead of the air might not be enough to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed.

<p>More frequently, nevertheless, investigators will need to come to the building to carry out individual interviews with occupants, to look for possible sources of the issues, and to examine the design and operation of the ventilation system and other building features.
