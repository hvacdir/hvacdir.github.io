<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative impact on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
