<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems include not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capacity.
