<p>We take a look at ideas before we supply guidance to change rather than repair a heating unit. One of the hints we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we understand the unit is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be losing cash by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is normally higher than many heat pump alternatives, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the model you purchase.

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
