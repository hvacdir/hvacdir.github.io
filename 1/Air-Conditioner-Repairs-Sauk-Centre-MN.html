<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heat pumps work very well in temperate climates like King and South Snohomish counties. Working on electrical power, a heat pump is an affordable solution utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse. Rather of warming or cooling the air already inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and presses it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home will not heat up.
