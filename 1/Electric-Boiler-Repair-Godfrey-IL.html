For this reason, it is necessary to pay attention to the time and place the signs occur. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort needs to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects might be made worse by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions widespread in the home.<p>
