<p>Info offered in this safety guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the issues provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring companies. Structures continuously progress as an outcome of the modifications in the environment around them along with the residents, products, and activities within them. The various surfaces and the air inside a structure are continuously interacting, and this interaction results in modifications in each. For example, we may see a window as changing somewhat gradually as it becomes filthy, then is cleaned, accumulates dirt once again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see may be evolving as a result of the interactions among the moisture, chemicals, and biological products discovered there.<p>
