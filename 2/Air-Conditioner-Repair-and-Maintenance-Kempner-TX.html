<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, given that it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
