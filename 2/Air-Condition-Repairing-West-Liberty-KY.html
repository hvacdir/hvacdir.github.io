<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating devices can last for years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills suddenly seem higher than normal, it is most likely time to consider a brand-new system.

A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
