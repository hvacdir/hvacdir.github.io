<h3>Advantages of Professional AC Repair in Mount Shasta CA</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are extremely effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is always at a continuous temperature. These systems can obtain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just achieve an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE rates how much heat a system eliminates or produces (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling impact. A lot of ground source heatpump have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this indicates is that for every system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
