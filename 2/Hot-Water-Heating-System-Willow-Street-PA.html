<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. If your air conditioner is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leaks, just adding refrigerant is not an option. A qualified technician needs to repair any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the appropriate amount of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and efficiency of your air conditioner is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>
<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a separate split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, because a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
