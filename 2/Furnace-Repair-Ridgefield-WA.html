<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up. If products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be maintained at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>Sometimes a momentary indoor air quality issue is developed merely by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity happening inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's required, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more complex issues-- determined by consistently inappropriate air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods listed below might be proper.<p>
