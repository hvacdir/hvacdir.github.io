<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
