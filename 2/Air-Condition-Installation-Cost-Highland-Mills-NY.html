<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Highland Mills NY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it merely takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
