Some impacts may be worsened by an inadequate supply of outdoor air coming inside or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions common inside your home.<p>
<p>Examine these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your home are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
