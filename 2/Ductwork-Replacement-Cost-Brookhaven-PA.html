<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those common air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not just does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it likewise wears down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which generally consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
