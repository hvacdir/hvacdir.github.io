<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.

Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end goal.
