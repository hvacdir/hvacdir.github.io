<h3>Heat Pump Air Conditioner in Kokomo IN 46901</h3>
<p>Forced air systems are the most common heating system types on the market, but they're not always the very best choice for each home.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
