<p>Oil heating systems are generally not very effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however most do not accomplish an efficiency higher than 90%.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues.

Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
