<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems in homes.

Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes oil, gas or electrical power to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in individual spaces. All-electric boilers can attain approximately 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
