<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
