<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the home. Pollutants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground listed below. An air contaminant might also originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted space, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products.
