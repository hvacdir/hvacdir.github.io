Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J computation and must be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. If your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square video footage alone, relocate to another contractor. Just like determining the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, figuring out the proper size of system for your home also depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
