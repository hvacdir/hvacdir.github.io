<h3>Electric Heating System in Manistee MI 49660</h3>

(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
