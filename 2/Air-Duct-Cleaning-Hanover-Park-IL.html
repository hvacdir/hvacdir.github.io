<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Nick B. offered exceptional, personalized, mindful, and quality service. His interaction design is friendly, interesting and effective. He clearly and thoroughly discussed all issues and fixes in a manner that made me confident in his ability to solve my repair problems. He followed through and went the extra mile to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, guaranteeing repairs were made so that my spouse and I would not have to endure another night without heat, throughout one of the coldest winter seasons in current memory. He likewise reacted to my call immediately the next early morning, and coached me through a temporary fix to an issue that couldn't be resolved on the very first check out due to unavailable parts. I trust Nick's abilities, experience and ability to provide constant, quality service.<p>
