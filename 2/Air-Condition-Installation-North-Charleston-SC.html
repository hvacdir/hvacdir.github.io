He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company many years back and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year.
