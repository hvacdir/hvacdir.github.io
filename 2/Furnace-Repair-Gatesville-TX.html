<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals.

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent.

<p>A third method to choose whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
