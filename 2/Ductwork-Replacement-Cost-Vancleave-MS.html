The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
