<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
