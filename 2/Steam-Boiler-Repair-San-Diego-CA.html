Because they do not require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
