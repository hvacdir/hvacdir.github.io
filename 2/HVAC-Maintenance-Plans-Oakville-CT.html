<p>As much of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in location. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is often hard to quantify, as one reaction specified the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or a/c don't just break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the outcome of repeated usage of a part that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, leading to holes and cracks. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  a very useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
