<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
