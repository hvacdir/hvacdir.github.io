<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Hollywood FL</h3>
<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. Many house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of contaminants directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
