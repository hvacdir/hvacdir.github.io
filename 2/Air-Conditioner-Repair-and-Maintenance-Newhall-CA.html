<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature throughout the year. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out a few of those common air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the roadway.
