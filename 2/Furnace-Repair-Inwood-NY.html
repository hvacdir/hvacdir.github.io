The copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. The next action is to thaw your air conditioning devices if you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing. The most convenient way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
