<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
