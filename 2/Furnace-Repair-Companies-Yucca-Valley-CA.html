One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to resist present, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat supplies warmth from the floor up throughout the room without any cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
