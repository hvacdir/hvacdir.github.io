<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ might notice unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, speak to your doctor about them. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
