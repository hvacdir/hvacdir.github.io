<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>

<p>We look at ideas prior to we provide suggestions to replace rather than repair a heater. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy bills are high compared to use, or if energy bills are greater every year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more effective design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
