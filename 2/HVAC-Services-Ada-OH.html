I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
