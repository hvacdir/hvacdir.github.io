<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a efficient and straightforward approach to decrease ambient air pollution and potential health dangers, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
