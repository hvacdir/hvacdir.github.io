<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers utilized various approaches. The CMHC research study contacted a number of duct-cleaning services. The companies were not warned they became part of a research study, and the scientists did not control for time spent or techniques used. The EPA study recommended and controlled techniques utilized on a smaller sized number of homes. While the duct-cleaning industry argues both studies have defects, no other research has actually challenged the findings. And although the equipment and methods utilized by duct-cleaning companies have altered given that these studies were performed, the duct in homes haven't.<p>
