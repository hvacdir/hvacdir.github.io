One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are forced to withstand existing, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators.
