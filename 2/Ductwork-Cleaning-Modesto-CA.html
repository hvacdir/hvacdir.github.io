<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " primary ecological hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how hazardous lead could be, it was used in paint, fuel, water pipes, and numerous other items.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them until they have been effectively dried. Attempt a various dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, look for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can show your house might not have adequate ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, smelly or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and areas where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To spot smells in your home, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
