<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can become reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
