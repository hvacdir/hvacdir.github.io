<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical attributes of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
