<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol result, the majority of typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often release water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
