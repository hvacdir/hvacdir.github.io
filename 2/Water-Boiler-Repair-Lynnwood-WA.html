<p>When the level of brand-new building and construction activity decreases, service technicians who specialize in brand-new installation work might experience periods of joblessness.

<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience periodic periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them once again. Shut off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, switch off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the a/c service still doesn't work appropriately after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>
