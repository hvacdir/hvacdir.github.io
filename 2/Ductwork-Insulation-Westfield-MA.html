<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a reliable and straightforward method to lower ambient air contamination and potential health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to offer your home that perfect temperature level throughout the year.
