<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and building residents may be exposed to a variety of contaminants (in the type of gases and particles) from workplace makers, cleaning items, construction furnishings, activities and carpets, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), pests, and outside pollutants. Other elements such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how individuals react to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
