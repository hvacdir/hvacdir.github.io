Forced air systems will need a water-to-air heatpump while hydronic radiant heating systems will need water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop needed depends on the heating and cooling requirements for your home and is crucial iin making sure the performance and efficiency of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is determined in loads. Typically, a 3-ton setup must be enough for the average home, but home size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all factors which will affect the proper size for your specific home.
