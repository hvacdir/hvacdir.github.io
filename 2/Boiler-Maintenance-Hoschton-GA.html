<p>Geothermal heatpump can be easily integrated with existing systems such as standard forced air or radiant flooring heating or can be set up in a brand-new structure. Forced air systems will need a water-to-air heatpump while hydronic radiant heating systems will need water-to-water heat pumps. The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop needed depends on the heating and cooling requirements for your home and is crucial iin making sure the performance and efficiency of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is determined in loads. Typically, a 3-ton setup must be enough for the average home, but home size, heating and cooling requirements, local geology and soil, and land accessibility are all factors which will affect the proper size for your specific home. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you properly size a system.<p>

<p>Property owners may likewise presume that because a radiant flooring heating system can be seen (and financed) as a home enhancement, its installation will instantly raise their house's worth. No evidence exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or negatively impacts property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the yearly Cost vs. Worth Report provided by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Renovation Publication. Perhaps Real estate agents must think about too many variables to definitively specify what a radiant heating system may contribute to, or deduct from, any given asking rate. That said, homebuyers looking to go green," who focus on energy cost savings, or who absolutely want an in-floor heating system will want to pay a premium for a home that features one.<p>
