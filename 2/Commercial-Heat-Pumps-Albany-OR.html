<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives generally total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial price of a system competitive with conventional devices.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the right conditions.<p>
