The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have 2 major components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Some health results may appear quickly after a single exposure or repeated exposures to a toxin. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness.
