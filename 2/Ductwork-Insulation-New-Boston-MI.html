In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
