<p>Great Item! Delivery was kind of strange being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we dealt with issues. I would suggest this item to anyone who's renovating or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "regular" occupational direct exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to determine if the general indoor air quality meets a specific requirement. Occupational exposure limits noted in health and safety guidelines and the Limit Limitation Values ® (TLVs) recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to prevent disease or specific results (like eye and nose inflammation) in industrial scenarios. These limitations might not be proper in office settings or for the house.<p>

<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
