Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with newbies more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>I highly advise using this service. Very reputable very nice. Took care of a part that was not covered under service warranty quickly and effective and did not need to pay a leg and an arm to get it done. Terrific company started by a man who is looking to grow his organisation and protect his household. He installed a total system inside and out. Terrific unit and a great cost. I am presently on the maintance strategy. He takes care of it two times a year with out needing to be reminded to do it.<p>
