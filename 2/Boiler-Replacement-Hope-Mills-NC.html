<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
