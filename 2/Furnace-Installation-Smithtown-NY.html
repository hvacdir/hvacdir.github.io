<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
