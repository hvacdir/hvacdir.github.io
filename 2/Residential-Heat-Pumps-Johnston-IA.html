<p>The properties and composition of the soil in an area can impact the rate at which heat is carried out through the ground. These should be considered before selecting the best design of an underground heating & cooling system. Soil with favorable heat transfer homes needs less pipes to achieve the desired underground heating & cooling impact, while those with reduced thermal conductivity will require more pipes.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are especially at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition worsened by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke causes throat, nose, and eye irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually connected direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFORMATION), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might observe undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>Only a specialist can properly diagnose why your furnace isn't starting. If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something appears strange or you lose confidence, it's time to call an expert. Similarly, if the process does not work, something else is wrong and you need a technician to examine the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, however you find you have to do it often, it's probably time for an expert viewpoint.<p>
