Loosen the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Photo 6).<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
