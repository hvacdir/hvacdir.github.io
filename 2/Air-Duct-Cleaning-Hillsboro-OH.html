<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>

<p>I called Snowflake Air due to the fact that my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
