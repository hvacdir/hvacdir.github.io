<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
