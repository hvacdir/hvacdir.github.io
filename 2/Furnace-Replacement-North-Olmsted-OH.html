<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the flooring. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
