<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
