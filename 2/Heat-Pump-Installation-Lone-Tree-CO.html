<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
