Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to offer sufficient modifications to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this.

The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
