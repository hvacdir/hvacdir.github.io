<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few affordable ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post set up assessment outcomes look excellent for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools far better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
