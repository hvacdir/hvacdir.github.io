PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room cooling provides optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
