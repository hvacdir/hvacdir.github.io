<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
