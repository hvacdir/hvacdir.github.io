<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
