<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely pleased that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
