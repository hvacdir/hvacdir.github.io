<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price great however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my home and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up examination results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>

<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement attempts to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out regular maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months before the present one expired. She didn't need a air filtration system, however they talked her into it.<p>
