Initially, use exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surface areas. Or, as an option, think about using solid wood items. Second of all, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make certain that a reliable wetness barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it becomes damp.<p>
