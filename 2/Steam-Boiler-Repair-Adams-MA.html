<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Adams Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the visit. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was extremely happy they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
