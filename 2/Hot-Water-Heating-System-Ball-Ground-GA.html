<h3>HVAC Contractors in Ball Ground Georgia</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the evaporator, compressor, and condenser are all situated in one cabinet, which generally is put on a roof or on a concrete piece next to the house's foundation.

<p>A geothermal heating system is more reliable than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external elements, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar energy.
