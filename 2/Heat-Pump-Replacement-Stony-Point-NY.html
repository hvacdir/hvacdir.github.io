<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to offer automobile debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
