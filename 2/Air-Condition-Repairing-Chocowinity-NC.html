<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Chocowinity NC 27817</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, expert and very well done. The installers were respectful and knew precisely what to do. I am an engineer by profession and recognize quickly individuals who are proficient at what they do. I was impressed with the installers as they are excellent and do not miss out on information that produces a job very well done. I very extremely advise the two gentlemen as they are outstanding at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and appreciation for a task well done.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, created by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
