<p>While pollutants frequently found in indoor air are responsible for lots of harmful impacts, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of exposure are needed to produce particular health problems. Individuals also respond extremely differently to exposure to indoor air contaminants. Further research study is required to better comprehend which health effects happen after direct exposure to the average pollutant concentrations discovered in homes and which take place from the higher concentrations that happen for short amount of times.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, consider possible impacts of indoor air pollution. Follow the maker's directions, especially instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system correctly adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heater remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating system is located to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
