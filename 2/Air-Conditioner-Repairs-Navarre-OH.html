The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
