In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Oil furnaces tend to be higher in maintenance than other types. They produce a lot of soot, which requires to be correctly vented and cleaned from the furnace regularly. Change the filters periodically and have your ductwork cleaned up since the soot develops inside the ducts, decreasing their efficiency over time.
