<p>A packaged unit, typically installed on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is likewise an option for house owners to consider. Often times, these systems include not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those looking to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, because the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically only readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best option for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
