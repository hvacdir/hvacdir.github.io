<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like extended automobile warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair.
