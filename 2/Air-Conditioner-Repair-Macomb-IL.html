The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known quantity of money coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
