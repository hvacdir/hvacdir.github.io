<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of outside or commercial settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the building. It may likewise include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific spaces.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
