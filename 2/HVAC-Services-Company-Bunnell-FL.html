We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioning system before you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>
