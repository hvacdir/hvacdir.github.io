The bacterium forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Removal for Legionella break outs in commercial buildings differ, but typically include very hot water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in some cases flushes of heavy metal salts.

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
