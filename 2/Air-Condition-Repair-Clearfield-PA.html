<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for modern air conditioning unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>The capability of natural chemicals to cause health effects varies significantly, from those that are highly toxic, to those with no known health result.

At present, very little is understood about what health effects happen from the levels of organics usually discovered in homes. Lots of natural substances are known to cause cancer in animals; some are believed of causing, or are known to cause, cancer in human beings.<p>
