<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging product to protect it from damage.

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
