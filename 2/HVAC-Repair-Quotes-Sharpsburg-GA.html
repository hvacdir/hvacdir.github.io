<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
