<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Greenwood SC 29646</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
