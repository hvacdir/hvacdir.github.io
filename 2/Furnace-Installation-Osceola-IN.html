<p>Let's start by detailing the planning that needs to occur before you actually buy a furnace. Selecting a furnace for your home isn't as basic as selecting one off a showroom flooring. Not all furnaces are good for all homes, and there are a number of factors that definitely need to be considered prior to choosing one. First, you'll need one that is correctly sized for your home. A furnace that is too large will put out excessive heat for your system to deal with, and will trigger issues like short-cycling that can reduce its life.
