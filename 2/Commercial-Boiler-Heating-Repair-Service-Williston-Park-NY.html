<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
