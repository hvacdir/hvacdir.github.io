<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
