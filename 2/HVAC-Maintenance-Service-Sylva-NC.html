<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
