The copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too if your evaporator coil is frozen. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you found that your conditioning filter needs replacing, then the next action is to thaw your air conditioning devices. The most convenient way to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>If you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heater, think about possible effects of indoor air contamination. Follow the manufacturer's directions, particularly guidelines on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater effectively adjusted.

While a space heater is in use, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the rest of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
