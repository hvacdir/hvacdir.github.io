<p>We look at clues before we provide suggestions to change rather than repair a heater. One of the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering cash by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it soaks up heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. At the same time, heat is taken in from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
