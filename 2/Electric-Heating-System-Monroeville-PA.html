<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can become air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
