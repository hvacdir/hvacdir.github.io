<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
