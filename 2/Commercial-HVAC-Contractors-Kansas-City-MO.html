<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps in Kansas City MO</h3>

Much like other kinds of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). POLICE OFFICER rates just how much heat a system gets rid of or produces (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling result. Many ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0.
