<p>Prior to you head out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning unit? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How large should the a/c be? Too large and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning system and reduce its life. Too small and your ac system won't have the ability to cool the house effectively. These are just a few of the elements that you need to consider when shopping for a new AC system.

<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system likewise might add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may become clogged, decreasing air flow circulation, volume, and quality.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also need to be correctly maintained to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is often crucial to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring data is not readily available, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent must ask for that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Review of this data might identify potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
