<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material gradually. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
