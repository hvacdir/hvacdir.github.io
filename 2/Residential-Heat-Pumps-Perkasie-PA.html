Every maintenance task may need absolutely various steps and processes than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being inspected.

<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace.

Older units from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is squandered throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a relatively simple procedure. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
