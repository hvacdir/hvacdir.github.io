<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any air flow limitation will lower the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
