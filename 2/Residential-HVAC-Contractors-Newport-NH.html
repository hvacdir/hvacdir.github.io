<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your car.

Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
