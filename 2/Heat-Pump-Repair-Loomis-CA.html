<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
