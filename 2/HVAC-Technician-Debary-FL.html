While there aren't numerous repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance treatments you can follow to keep your system running at peak effectiveness.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
