<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
