<h3>Gas Central Heating in Woodbine NJ 08270</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
