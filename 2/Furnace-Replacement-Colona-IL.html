<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
