<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They consist of delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, kids, and infants are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the harmful impacts of lead.
