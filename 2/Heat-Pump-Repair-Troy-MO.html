<p>If no pollutant sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stagnant air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air.

<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels inside.

<p>Outdoor impurities. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Professionals suggest using filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and usually are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>

Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
