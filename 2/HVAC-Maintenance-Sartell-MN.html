<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
