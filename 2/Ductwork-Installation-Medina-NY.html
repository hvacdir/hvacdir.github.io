Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might try to find and purchase it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely thankful to have a heated house once again. What's most remarkable was that this all occurred throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to assist us right prior to a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
