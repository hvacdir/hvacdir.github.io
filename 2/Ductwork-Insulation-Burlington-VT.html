<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Burlington VT</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants emitted by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high indoors may cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units may be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, screeching noises from a belt-drive air handler normally occur. In many cases, the belt is improperly aligned or used and requires replacement. Follow the guidelines above under Air Conditioner Not Blowing Air and refer to your owner's manual.<p>
