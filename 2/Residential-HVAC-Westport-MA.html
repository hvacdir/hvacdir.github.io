<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you should watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
