<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
