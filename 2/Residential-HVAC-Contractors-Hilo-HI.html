From one of the most basic, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters assist with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness. The objective is to provide enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
