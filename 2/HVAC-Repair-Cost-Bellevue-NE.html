<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off totally.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the convected heat system has actually been running for a while, consisting of people. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that exact same aquifer.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
