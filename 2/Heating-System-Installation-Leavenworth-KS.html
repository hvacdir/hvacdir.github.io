<p>Do you need to replace or repair part of your home's HVAC system?

<p>A 3rd method to choose whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, search for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can show your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To spot smells in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become airborne. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
