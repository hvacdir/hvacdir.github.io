<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, since it is safeguarded inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical guidelines remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>

<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and possibly refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at maximum performance and might overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, creating a cycle that does not end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy costs to increase. It's possible that the size of AC system you have is not big enough for your house. If the system is too little, it will have to work harder and may overheat. Normally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
