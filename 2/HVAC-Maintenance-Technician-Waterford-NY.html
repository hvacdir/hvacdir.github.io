<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They include delays in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Kids, fetuses, and infants are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Kids might have greater exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>
