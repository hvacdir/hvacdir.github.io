<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Children, fetuses, and infants are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than adults because lead is more quickly soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the damaging impacts of lead. Kids may have higher exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Salt Lake City UT 84118</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your cooling furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts off all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on unusual events.<p>
