<p>There are a few possibilities to discuss short biking in extremely cold weather. The most apparent is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the extremely low temperature levels. Often, the furnace will just run harder to maintain a warm environment for your house when the weather condition is very cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. If you require clarity on this issue, contact one of our technicians.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can vary from impurities generated from the outdoors by your family pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air toxin resulting from natural gas that leaves into your house without being burnt. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where wetness levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
