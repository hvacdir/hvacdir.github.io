<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power ought to not exceed the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, considering that the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside system. Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into consideration not just the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
