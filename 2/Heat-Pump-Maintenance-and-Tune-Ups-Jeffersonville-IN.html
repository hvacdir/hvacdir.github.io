<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted two local companies for bids. While both were helpful and valuable, Ballard Gas offered us a better offer, for exceptional service.
