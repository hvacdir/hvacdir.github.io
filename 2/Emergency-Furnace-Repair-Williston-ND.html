<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
