A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive use of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature degeneration, resulting in holes and fractures. If that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.  a really beneficial outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
