<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around given that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping device to distribute hot water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the flooring heat transferred heat to other articles in the rooms, including the human residents.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being clogged with particles that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Dirty filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to close down completely. By contrast, inspecting and changing a furnace filter can typically be done in simply a couple of minutes, typically with no tools required. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to switch off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
