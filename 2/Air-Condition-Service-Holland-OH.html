<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
