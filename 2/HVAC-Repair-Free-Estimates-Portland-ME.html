<h3>AC Compressor in Portland ME 04103</h3>

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures through mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air" or split-system cooling", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioner to the home.

Discover how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
