<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is upgraded every four years. The Basics Handbook consists of heating and cooling calculations.

<p>Energy efficiency can be enhanced a lot more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating unit. Zones are managed by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is extremely important to keeping a proper temperature.<p>

<p>Area Ventilation. Outside exhaust fans ought to be installed in all restrooms and cooking areas. These fans remove humidity and carbon monoxide. The most effective fans are resilient and peaceful.
