<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 load system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Through typical usage and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c unit may end up being extremely dirty. These aspects of the devices are vital for efficient air conditioning.

The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel need to be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t appropriately identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to diagnose.<p>
