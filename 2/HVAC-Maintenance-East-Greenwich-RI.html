<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
