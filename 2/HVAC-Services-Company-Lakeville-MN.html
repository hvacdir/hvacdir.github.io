<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
