<p>Filters can get unclean quickly, especially if you reside in an area that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, germs, and clean the air. They are accountable for maintaining the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned up and changed frequently.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
