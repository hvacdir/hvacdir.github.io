<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
