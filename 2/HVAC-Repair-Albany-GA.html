<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company.

<h3>What Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Albany GA?</h3>
<p>In the last a number of years, a growing body of clinical evidence has suggested that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously contaminated than the outdoor air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research study shows that individuals invest roughly 90 percent of their time indoors. Therefore, for many individuals, the risks to health might be greater due to direct exposure to air contamination inside your home than outdoors.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in autos in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by certified HVAC service technicians. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>
