<h3>Electric Heating System in Prairie Village KS 66208</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
