<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work.

<h3>Hints to Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Lake View NY</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>In general, repair and renovation activities in owner occupied real estate units are not subject to specific guidelines related to the management of lead.
