<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in many cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
