<h3>Air Condition Company in Troutdale OR 97060</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
