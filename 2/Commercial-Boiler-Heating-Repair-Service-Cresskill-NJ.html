<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day ac system) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
