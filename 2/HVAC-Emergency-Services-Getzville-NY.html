<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
