<p>The majority of well and city water does not normally consist of lead. Water typically picks up lead inside the house from home plumbing that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested, the only way to understand. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to find out how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for additional information.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit, think about possible results of indoor air pollution. Follow the producer's instructions, specifically directions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating system effectively adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indication of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heater remains in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
