<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summer. Connection problems along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the system. Loose, missing or defective wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and disrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace involves examining the suggested connections along with temperature and pressure gauges. Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and secure.<p>
<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious. They include delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Children, fetuses, and babies are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Kids might have higher direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
