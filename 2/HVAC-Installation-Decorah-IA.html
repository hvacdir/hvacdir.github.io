<p>Co2 (CO2) is a fairly simple to determine surrogate for indoor toxins discharged by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high inside your home might trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the primary indoor source of co2 in a lot of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in automobiles in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be purchased and used by qualified HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many individuals.<p>
