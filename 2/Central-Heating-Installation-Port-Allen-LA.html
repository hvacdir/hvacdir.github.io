<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " number one environmental hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was known how harmful lead might be, it was utilized in paint, fuel, pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct work runs in between $300 to $500 usually. It's the ductwork that provides cold air to each room in your house, and if it develops cracks which leak, they need to be fixed.
