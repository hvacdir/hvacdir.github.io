<p>Space air conditioners include a thermostat sensor, situated behind the control board, which determines the temperature of air entering into the evaporative coil. The air conditioner could cycle constantly or behave erratically if the sensor is knocked out of position. The sensor should be near the coil however not touching it; adjust its position by thoroughly bending the wire that holds it in place.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
