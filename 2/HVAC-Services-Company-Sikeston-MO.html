<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to guarantee your factory warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often difficult to quantify, as one response mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive usage of a component that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, leading to fractures and holes. If that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.  a very beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
