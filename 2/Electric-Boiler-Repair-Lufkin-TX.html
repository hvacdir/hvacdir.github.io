<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the system. Loose, faulty or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of keeping your furnace involves examining the recommended connections in addition to temperature and pressure gauges. Take some time to check these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are protected and tight.<p>

The EPA study prescribed and controlled methods used on a smaller sized variety of homes. While the duct-cleaning market argues both studies have flaws, no other research study has actually challenged the findings.
