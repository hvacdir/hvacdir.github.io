<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives typically amount to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with conventional equipment. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout brand-new building and construction (homes normally use between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. However, new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to conventional systems under the right conditions.<p>
