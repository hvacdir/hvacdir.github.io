<h3>Understanding the Essentials of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance in Princeton MN</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even small window package units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions require.

Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
