<p>Info provided in this safety guide is based on present scientific and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Buildings constantly develop as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, products, and activities within them. The numerous surfaces and the air inside a building are constantly communicating, and this interaction leads to modifications in each. For instance, we may see a window as changing slightly with time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned up, collects dirt again, is cleaned up once again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see may be progressing as a result of the interactions amongst the wetness, chemicals, and biological products discovered there.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
