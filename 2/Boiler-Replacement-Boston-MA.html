<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
