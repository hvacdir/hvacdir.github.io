<p>Because they remove moisture from the air, Air conditioners can develop a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a normally plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area. To handle condensate problems, please see A/c unit Leaks Water, listed below.<p>

<p>Numerous AC systems come with a number of special features that can further enhance performance and effectiveness. For instance, house owners may wish to search for one that includes a built-in filter light that will notify you when the air filter requires to be altered. Another popular feature to search for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to lower energy expenses even more. Obviously, more features suggest higher central air conditioning costs.<p>
<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, but it is also an option for house owners to think about. Often times, these units include not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, since the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the very best option for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
