<p>Instant discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump innovations are readily available to equipment installers, used at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Outstanding Customer Care! Environment Pro is trustworthy and truly cared about us and our circumstance. We got back one night to a cold house. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came over that same night. Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might try to find and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hr after I called him, I was definitely glad to have a heated home once again. What's most fantastic was that this all happened throughout Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd discover someone to assist us right before a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
