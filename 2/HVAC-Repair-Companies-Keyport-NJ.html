<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
