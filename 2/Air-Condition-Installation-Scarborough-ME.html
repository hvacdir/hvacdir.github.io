<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to commercial or outdoor settings.

It might likewise consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to individual areas.<p>

Exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and structures build up inside.<p>
