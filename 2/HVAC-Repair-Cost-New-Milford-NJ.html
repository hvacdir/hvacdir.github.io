Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
