<h3>Air Condition Unit Cost in Park Ridge IL 60068</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and unclean.

A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
