<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Many times, these systems include not just the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, considering that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally just available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than buying simply a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best alternative for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
