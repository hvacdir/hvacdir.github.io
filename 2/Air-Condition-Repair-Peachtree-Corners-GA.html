<h2>How To Hire HVAC Contractors in Peachtree Corners</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Appropriate ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues.

If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
