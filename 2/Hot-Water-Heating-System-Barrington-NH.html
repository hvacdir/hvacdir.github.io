<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
