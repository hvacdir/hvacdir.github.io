<p>Since things ran efficiently without any sound, I was extremely happy in the beginning. Additionally, I saw obvious changes in my electrical power costs. After 2 years, things started to alter. There have actually been awkward noises. I got it examined and repaired. I am hoping that is completion of the problem. Overall, it has been a great experience. Trustworthy on the whole.
