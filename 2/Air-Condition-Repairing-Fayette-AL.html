The crew took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We picked getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
