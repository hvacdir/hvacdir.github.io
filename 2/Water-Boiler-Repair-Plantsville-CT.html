Contaminants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, backyard garbage burning, or radon going into the house from the ground below.

Germs and infections, pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
