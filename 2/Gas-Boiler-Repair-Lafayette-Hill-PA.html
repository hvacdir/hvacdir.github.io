Service technicians are typically needed to work in confined locations, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofs of homes. They can be exposed to undesirable weather condition for extended periods of time. Considering that they are called to buildings without operating environment control, they are also subject to the extreme hot or cold temperatures existing inside a location.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is described as radiant heating.<p>

PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While space a/c provides maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
