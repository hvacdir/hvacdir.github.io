<p>Buildings are created or meant to respond actively to a few of these changes around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and preserve surfaces to enhance their efficiency, look, or durability. In other cases, such changes discreetly or even considerably modify buildings in manner ins which might be necessary to their own stability or their impact on structure residents through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that define them at any time. We might find it useful to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the approaches used by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to get an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we spend most of our time, our buildings.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, but it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more residents there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative effect on occupants-- outside air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
