<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the convected heat system has been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution problem exists if no pollutant sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions.

Stale air might also be a problem when ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the variety of workers in the area.<p>
<p>The EPA and CMHC researchers used different methodologies. The CMHC research study called on a number of duct-cleaning services. The companies were not made aware they were part of a research study, and the researchers did not manage for time spent or methods utilized. The EPA study prescribed and controlled methods utilized on a smaller number of homes. While the duct-cleaning market argues both research studies have defects, no other research has challenged the findings. And although the devices and techniques used by duct-cleaning companies have actually altered because these research studies were carried out, the air ducts in homes haven't.<p>
