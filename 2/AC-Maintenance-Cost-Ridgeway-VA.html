Co2 at levels that are uncommonly high inside your home may trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the main indoor source of co2 in many buildings.
