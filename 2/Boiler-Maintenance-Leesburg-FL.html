<p>The response to the concern, What does an HVAC technician do?, will vary somewhat depending on industry of position, specialized, and work. What does not vary is the importance of the work that these professionals do. Heating and cooling systems control the temperature level, humidity, and overall air quality in homes, office buildings, schools, hospitals, factories, stores, and other facilities. They help keep us comfy - and healthy! By supplying a climate regulated environment, refrigeration systems make it possible to shop and transport food, medicine, and other disposable products.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
