<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, since it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
