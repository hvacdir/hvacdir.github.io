<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units.
