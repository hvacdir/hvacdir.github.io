We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to check the air conditioner prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
