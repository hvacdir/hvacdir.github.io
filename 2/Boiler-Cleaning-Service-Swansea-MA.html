<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Heaters that kick on regularly may be due to an unclean filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
