<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer.

When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>

While a space heater remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating system lies to the remainder of the house and open a window somewhat.<p>
