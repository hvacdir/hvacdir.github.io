<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ may see musty or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk to your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
