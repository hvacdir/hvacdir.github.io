<p>Immediate impacts may show up after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate effects are treatable and typically short-term. Often the treatment is merely eliminating the individual's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also appear soon after exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from processes or products; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively harmless as a new carpet is likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include volatile chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Only a professional can precisely identify why your furnace isn't beginning. It's time to call an expert if at any point in the procedure of bleeding the furnace something seems strange or you lose confidence. Likewise, if the process doesn't work, something else is incorrect and you require a technician to analyze the furnace. Even if bleeding the furnace does work, but you discover you need to do it regularly, it's probably time for a professional opinion.<p>
