<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals frequently discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>There are a lot of advantages to utilizing a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heating unit. Radiant heating systems tend to be far more energy effective than other heating systems, for one thing. Forced air heater tend to suffer from things like duct leaks, which rob them of up to 30% of their output. Forced air heater likewise tend to create hot and cold areas throughout the house, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a space and sinks as it cools.<p>

<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was sort of weird being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was exceptionally lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we resolved problems. I would advise this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time.
