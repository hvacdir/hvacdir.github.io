<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and fixed the issue. Will certainly be using them once again.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they utilize air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a cars and truck radiator or typical home air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>

<h3>Methods To Get the Most out of Your HVAC System at Davidson NC</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to buy it. My better half stated that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the situation to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow.
