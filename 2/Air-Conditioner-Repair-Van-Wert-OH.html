<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working efficiently, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis. When you're running an HVAC company, you're on board for all the ups and downs that come with owning a high-demand, seasonal business. A carefully crafted business plan for an HVAC company is the initial step to manage those peaks and lulls so your revenues remain healthy year-round. If you didn't produce a heating & cooling organisation strategy when you started your service, it's not far too late to build one now, or to give your initial strategy an upgrade.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>In more complex plans, warm air is permitted to increase and stream out high building openings to the outdoors (stack effect ), triggering cool outdoors air to be drawn into low building openings.

Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition areas, however do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outside air when appropriate.<p>
