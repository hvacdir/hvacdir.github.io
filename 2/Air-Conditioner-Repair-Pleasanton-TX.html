<p>There is no single test to discover an IAQ issue. Your employer must check measurements of temperature, air and humidity flow. In addition, evaluation and screening of the ventilation, heating and cooling systems (to make sure it is working according to specifications for constructing use and tenancy) must be carried out. A structure walk-through to check for smells and try to find water damage, leakages, dirt or pest droppings may be valuable. Leaks need to be gotten rid of. Standing water in humidifiers, cooling units, on roofing systems and in boiler pans can end up being polluted with fungis or germs and need to be eliminated, likewise. In some circumstances, specific testing for radon or for asbestos might be required as part of structure occupancy. For instance, in schools asbestos needs to be examined every three years and re-inspected every 6 months (under the Asbestos Risk Emergency Response Act-AHERA).<p>
<p>We have been extremely pleased with Stability's devices (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten completed yearly maintenance of our system).

The couple of times we have needed them for emergency situations they responded quickly and resolved the problem.<p>
