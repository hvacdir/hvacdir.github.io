<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this type in the yards of houses. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the house. Nevertheless, there are some internal components too. Split systems are perfect for cooling numerous spaces simultaneously, but are not extremely energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home. At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might spend more money on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
