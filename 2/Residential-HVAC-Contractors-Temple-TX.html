From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance.

They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>

So, be sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service strategy which typically includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
