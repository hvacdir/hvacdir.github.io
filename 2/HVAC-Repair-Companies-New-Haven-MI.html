<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
