<p>Consumer products that contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive cleaners, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to trigger cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide in the body and can trigger symptoms connected with exposure to carbon monoxide gas. Thoroughly read the labels containing health hazard information and cautions on the correct use of these items. Use products which contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use inside just if the area is well aerated.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be needed.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may discover unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>No matter what kind of heating unit you have in your home, you can save cash and increase your comfort by appropriately maintaining and upgrading your equipment.
