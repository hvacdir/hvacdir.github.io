<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, but a property owner doesn't have the tools or abilities needed to examine refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart house owner, it's still required to have a specialist technician check the system regularly.<p>
<p>While pollutants frequently found in indoor air are responsible for numerous damaging results, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are needed to produce particular health issue.
