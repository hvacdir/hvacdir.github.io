<p>The federal government advises that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the quantity of energy required for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should also be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, citizens should look out to the emergence of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew growth. Additional weatherization steps must not be undertaken till these issues have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>Prior to you head out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning system? If your home is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How big should the ac system be? Too large and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can damage the a/c and shorten its life. Too little and your a/c unit will not be able to cool the house appropriately. These are just a few of the factors that you require to take into account when shopping for a brand-new AC system.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water.

A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might enter nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
