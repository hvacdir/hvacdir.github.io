<h3>Home Air Conditioning Installation in Trumbull CT 06611</h3>
<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually caused by the absence of adequate ventilation, which results in an accumulation of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the work environment indoor air examinations it has conducted. Investigations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the exact same to be true. These investigations revealed that proper ventilation is essential in keeping great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise evidence from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-effective approach to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later on in this section.<p>
