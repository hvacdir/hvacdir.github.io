<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Service in Willmar</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same toxins. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limitations utilize dose-response information which show the health effects of repeated direct exposure to one specific chemical. Similar data is not available for long-lasting, low-level exposures to a mix of contaminants as is the case for IAQ issues. Currently, there is not enough information available to anticipate the results of direct exposure to numerous potentially harmful agents at the very same time.<p>
