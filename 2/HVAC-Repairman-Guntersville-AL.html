Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of structure products, cigarette smoking, household products, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating systems.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
