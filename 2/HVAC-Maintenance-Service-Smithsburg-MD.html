<p>Aspects that can add to the growth of biological pollutants are damp or wet building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and badly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs.

<p>You ought to get your HVAC system visually checked at least when every year to make certain all the systems are working well. This examination is an important element of HVAC maintenance.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
