<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
