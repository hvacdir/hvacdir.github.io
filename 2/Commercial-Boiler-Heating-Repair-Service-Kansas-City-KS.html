<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Kansas City KS</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating unit. We chose getting something more pricey than a standard water heater as gas is among our biggest utility costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

If you've set up the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
