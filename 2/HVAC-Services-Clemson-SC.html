<p>5. Smell good naturally. You may associate that lemony or piney scent with a tidy cooking area or tidy synthetic scents in laundry products and air fresheners emit lots of various chemicals into the air. You won't find their names on the item labels. Traditional laundry cleaning agents, material softeners, dryer sheets, and air fresheners in solid, spray, and oil kind might all emit such gasses.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to preserve the effectiveness and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, much of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>In addition to the consumer reviews, you can find out a lot about an HVAC company by any awards they receive. There are lots of companies that strive to help educate the public about various companies. Angie's List might award a Super Service Award to the best HVAC company. The Bbb is a great place to look for customer fulfillment. The best HVAC company will be dedicated to making customers happy. Thus, they might have even gotten the BBB Award for Distinction, as Madd Air has numerous times. Many local companies who are committed to the very best service will also be recognized by local organizations who wish to see excellent service remain in the location.<p>
