<h3>Getting Throughout Central Heating Installation in Jackson OH</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the system has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
