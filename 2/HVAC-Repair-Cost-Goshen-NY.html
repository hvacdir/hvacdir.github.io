<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
