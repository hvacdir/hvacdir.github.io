<h3>Common Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Woodinville WA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in house building and construction is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floorings. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants exhaust them from the home.<p>
