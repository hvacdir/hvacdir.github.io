<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
