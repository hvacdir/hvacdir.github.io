<p>Increasing energy expenses are not the only reason for high expenses. Furnaces typically lose their efficiency as they age, particularly if they have actually not been properly maintained. As an outcome your oil or gas furnace may run longer to offer the same amount of heat. This will cause your energy expenses to increase. And, all of the cash you pay your energy utility companies monthly might be used to help you pay for a new, far more energy-efficient and energy conserving furnace. Start to compare the cost of your current heating costs with heating bills from the previous years. If there is a substantial difference, then it's time to replace your furnace.<p>
<h3>Furnace Cleaning in Winter Park Florida</h3>
<p>New furnaces are substantially more efficient than those of ten or more years back, cutting costs by as much as 30%.
