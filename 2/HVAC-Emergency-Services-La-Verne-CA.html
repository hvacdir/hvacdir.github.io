<h3>Understanding the Basics of Furnace, AC and HVAC Maintenance at La Verne CA</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively easy to measure surrogate for indoor contaminants produced by humans, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are unusually high inside might trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the maximum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in the majority of structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat circulation over the whole surface of a floor warms the lower half of the room, enveloping occupants in heat at a lower overall temperature level-- in some cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating unit." To put it simply, in-floor heating systems provide a different mode and level of comfort. And, as different public awareness campaigns have long advised us, the more comfy we feel, the more inclined we may be to push down our thermostat, in turn decreasing our energy expenditures.<p>
