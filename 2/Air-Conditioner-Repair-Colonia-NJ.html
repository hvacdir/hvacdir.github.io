<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
