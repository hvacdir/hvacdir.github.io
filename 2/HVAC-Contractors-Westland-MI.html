<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and detach block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to begin (see Be Client at Start-up," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor begins however the fan doesn't, the fan motor is most likely shot. Shut down the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover.

If  it does not, you have actually provided it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
