<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, much of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
