<h3>Assessing Commercial Boilers into Residential Boilers in Jerseyville IL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
