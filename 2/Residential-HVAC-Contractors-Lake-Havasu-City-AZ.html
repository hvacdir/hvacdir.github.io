<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of concern.

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
