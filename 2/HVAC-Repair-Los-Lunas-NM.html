<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
