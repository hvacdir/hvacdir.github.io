<p>HVAC Systems Can Add To Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also intensify indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system might be contaminated (since of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread these toxins throughout the home.

<p>New air conditioning unit generally range from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score implies greater energy efficiency and potentially lower energy bills. A good SEER ranking for you depends upon your house size, where you live and other elements.

<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Furnace in Haymarket VA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
