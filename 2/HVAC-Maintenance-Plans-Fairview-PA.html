<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system".

When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
