Gas furnace not blowing hot air? Simply as with switches, somebody might have shut off a gas valve and then forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a handle that's perpendicular to the gas pipeline, turn it so it's parallel. Gas furnace repair is depends on how old your furnace is. If you have an old furnace or boiler, you may have a pilot light. Eliminate the front panel and the burner cover and examine to make sure it's lit.<p>
<p>Air conditioning system producers usually make rugged, high quality products. If your air conditioning system stops working, begin by checking any fuses or circuit breakers. Let the system cool off for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch may have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>
