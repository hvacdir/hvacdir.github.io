As a society, we ensure that our houses are well-sealed and well-insulated, however we do not think enough about exposure to all the important things we position in our houses," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they utilize air to exchange heat, in the same way as a cars and truck radiator or normal household a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outside air.<p>

<p>It's not instantly clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big merchant who asked not to be named because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that routinely keeps an eye on energy consumption and temperatures in stores to save on costs (especially in the evening) and to alert store managers if temperature levels in the shops fluctuate beyond an appropriate variety that could avoid customers from shopping at the shop.<p>
