<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the automobile debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
