<p>A health questionnaire must be established and distributed to all concerned workers. Such a tool needs to recognize the number of people impacted; specify ages and job descriptions of involved employees; figure out where they lie within the workplace; suggest when the symptoms happen (time of day, day of week, and season); offer a list of specific health signs or illnesses; identify all devices run in the workplace; indicate the kind of outside air pollution; and identify potential sources of task tension.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>

The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
