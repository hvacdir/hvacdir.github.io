<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for house owners to consider. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, because the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are usually just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best choice for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
