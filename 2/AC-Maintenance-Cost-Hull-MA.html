<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
