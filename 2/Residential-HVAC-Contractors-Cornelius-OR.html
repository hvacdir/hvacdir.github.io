<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, given that it is protected inside. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating unit can likewise be connected to a gadget called a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat produced from the ground source heat pump compressor and utilizes it to heat water. This suggests that this gadget can also provide totally free hot water for domestic usage in addition to its conventional geothermal heating and cooling purpose.<p>
