<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. Once the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively harden and cure-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
