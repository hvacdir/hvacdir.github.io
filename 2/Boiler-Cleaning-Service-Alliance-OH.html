Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation.
