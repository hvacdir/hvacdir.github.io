After 2 years, things began to change. There have actually been uncomfortable noises. I got it checked and repaired. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. Overall, it has been an excellent experience. Reputable on the whole. Neat operation and excellent cooling system. Yes, I was not pleased with its appearances in the start. But then realized ACs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>

ItÃ¢ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to identify.<p>
