<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
