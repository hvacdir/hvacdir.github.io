<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Vital Company in Los Angeles.

<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted 2 local companies for bids. While both were helpful and valuable, Ballard Natural Gas provided us a much better deal, for exceptional service. Rather than an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and located ways we could have more even heat. He included these significant but small changes in his quote. Because of recent warmer summers and for ecological factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems.

This means that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>The properties and structure of the soil in a location can impact the rate at which heat is conducted through the ground.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
