<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical material gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
