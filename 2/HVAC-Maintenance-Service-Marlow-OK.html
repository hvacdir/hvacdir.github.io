<p>Many people undervalue the extent of the indoor air contamination problem. Air contamination is usually envisioned as the black smoke produced from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, cleaners, paints, and pesticides used in the home. To intensify the issue, it is estimated that the average American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time inside your home, and majority that time is spent in the house.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality specialists can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To reduce toxins, we suggest installing innovative air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are developed to remove the tiniest particles from the air.

The majority of store-bought filters can not remove these smallest of irritants and don't eliminate gases and germs.<p>

Signs of these illness do disappoint up till many years after direct exposure started. Most people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the task; some developed disease from exposure to clothing and devices brought house from job sites.<p>

In addition, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
