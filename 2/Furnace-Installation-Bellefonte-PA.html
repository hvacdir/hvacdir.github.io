They are likewise frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy.

The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
