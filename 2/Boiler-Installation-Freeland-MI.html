<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call business several years earlier and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
