<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions because they don't need any new ductwork to be installed. Because an unit is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
