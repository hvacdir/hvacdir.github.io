<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, rather than outside or industrial settings. For example, promoting maintenance services to existing consumers during the sluggish season can help relieve the peak season strain on your tech team, as kept in mind in Cooling, Heating and Refrigeration (ACHR) News Professionals can primarily concentrate on reacting to calls from brand-new customers, while your established consumers stay happy as their HVAC systems hum along nicely thanks to proactive examinations. The marketing portion of your business plan for an HVAC company ought to consist of how you'll market these kinds of services.<p>

<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and area of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system functioning) on a Friday. This allows products to off-gas over the weekend while the majority of the staff are at house over the weekend. Area control includes moving the contaminant source away from residents or even moving prone occupants.<p>
<p>During normal furnace operation, dust, dirt, wetness from humidity or condensation, and microbial growths can develop on internal parts.

<p>Outdoor impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens discovered in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Professionals advise using filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller particles and generally are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>
