<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood items made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items produced indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board contains a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is normally recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals utilized in the construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops should be used with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems set up to eliminate products of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can also create particulates and must be vented outside.<p>

<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
