<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical material with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
