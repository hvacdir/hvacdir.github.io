<p>Glowing heating systems do not utilize ducts, which makes them a fair bit more energy effective than other systems. They also don't create hot and cold spots.

Radiant heat systems can also heat spaces with less energy spent, and keep them heated for longer, because the majority of floorings tend to keep heat better than air does.<p>
