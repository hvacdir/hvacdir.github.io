Just as with switches, somebody may have turned off a gas valve and after that forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a deal with that's perpendicular to the gas pipe, turn it so it's parallel. Gas furnace repair is depends on how old your furnace is. You may have a pilot light if you have an old furnace or boiler. Remove the front panel and the burner cover and check to make certain it's lit.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up.
