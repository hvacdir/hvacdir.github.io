<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this key in the backyards of homes. With split system units, most of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal components too.

At the very same time, the con would be that those who use this may invest more money on cooling expenses in the long run since of the lower energy performance.<p>
