<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For West Sacramento CA Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house building is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofs. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by only utilizing the services of a certified contractor or a certified representative from an organisation or merchant to do the installation. If you choose to try to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed person to do the work, in the majority of, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the cooling system. A voided warranty won't do you any great ought to the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the start and employ a certified individual with the experience to set up the system.<p>
