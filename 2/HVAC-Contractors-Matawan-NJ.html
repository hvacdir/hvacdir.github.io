<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, search for signs of problems with the ventilation in your home. Signs that can suggest your house might not have enough ventilation consist of wetness condensation on windows or walls, smelly or stuffy air, filthy central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other items end up being musty. To discover smells in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often vital to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can often be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking data from the company. If keeping an eye on data is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union agent need to request that the employer have air monitoring tests performed. Evaluation of this data might recognize potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
