During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
