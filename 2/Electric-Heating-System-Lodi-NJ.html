<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
