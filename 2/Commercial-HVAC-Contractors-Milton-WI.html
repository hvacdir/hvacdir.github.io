This is generally used in a second or third-floor  location and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional density of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist areas are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipelines to direct heat upward.<p>
