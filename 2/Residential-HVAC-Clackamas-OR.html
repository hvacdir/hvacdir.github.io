<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating unit does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, coal, or gas. Rather, it takes in heat from within the earth. In addition, a geothermal heating and cooling system utilizes substantially less electrical power compared to a basic electric heat-resistance heatpump. This makes a geothermal heating system an appealing solution to cut your carbon footprint, supplying a positive impact on the environment.<p>
