<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>If your single phase a/c unit isn't old sufficient to justify replacement, consider a whole home dehumidifier. By installing dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy a few of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without changing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and enabling greater comfort at greater temperature levels.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
