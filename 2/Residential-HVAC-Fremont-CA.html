<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. Once the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and treat-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>As pointed out above, activating your new under tile flooring heater prematurely, before the mortar has treated, can cause the grout to crack or to not adhere appropriately, and might void the warranty of your mortar product. In some screening, even the tile broken when the system was run prior to the substance had cured. If you do not follow their guidelines, and mortar manufacturers may decline warranty protection.<p>
