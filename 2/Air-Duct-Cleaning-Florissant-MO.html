<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or lab environments, instead of commercial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician may finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.
