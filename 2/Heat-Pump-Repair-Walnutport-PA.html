These convection heating systems are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>

Newer gas boilers should accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
