<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you ought to examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
