<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
