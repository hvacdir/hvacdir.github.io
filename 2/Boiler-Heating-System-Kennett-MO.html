<p>There are many reasons that this can occur. Fortunately is that you can deal with a lot of these elements on your own without the requirement to call for expert help. Start by opening the heat signs up and after that proceed to inspecting the thermostat settings. Next, inspect the furnace power, reset the furnace or examine the service door cover.

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
