<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
