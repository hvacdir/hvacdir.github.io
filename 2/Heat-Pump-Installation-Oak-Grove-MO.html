Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its placement on your property and its upkeep, it may sustain some damage throughout the winter season. Most of the time, this just consists of some accumulation of dirt and debris, which is quite basic to eliminate. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the outside of the unit and make sure that there is no rust, damage from built up moisture, or excessive wear to the exterior.

<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump.

An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
