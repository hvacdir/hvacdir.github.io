Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced.

<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
