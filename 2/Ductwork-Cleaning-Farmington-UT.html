<p>Chemical toxins: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, differed, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical substances. Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the building (e.g., office equipment; wall, furniture and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
