<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
