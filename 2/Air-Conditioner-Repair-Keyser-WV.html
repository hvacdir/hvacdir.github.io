<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Whatever heating system you install, it's essential that it's sized properly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will use excessive energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced. If the system is too little, then your home will not be heated up effectively and the system will have to constantly go to attempt to heat the whole home, which will increase heating bills.<p>
