<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Belmont MI Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>In the last a number of years, a growing body of scientific evidence has actually shown that the air within houses and other structures can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research suggests that people spend roughly 90 percent of their time inside. Therefore, for many individuals, the threats to health may be greater due to exposure to air pollution inside than outdoors.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat circulation over the entire surface area of a floor heats the lower half of the space, covering occupants in heat at a lower overall temperature-- sometimes up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating unit." Simply put, in-floor heating systems offer a various mode and level of convenience. And, as various public awareness projects have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenditures.<p>
