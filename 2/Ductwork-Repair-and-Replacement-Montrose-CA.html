<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
