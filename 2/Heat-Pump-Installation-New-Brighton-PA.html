<h3>Gas Furnace Repair in New Brighton PA 15066</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer breakdowns. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety switches that protect your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is also a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on unusual celebrations.<p>
