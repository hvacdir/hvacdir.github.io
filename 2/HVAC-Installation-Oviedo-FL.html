<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to provide enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
