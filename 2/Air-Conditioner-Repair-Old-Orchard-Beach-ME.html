<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
