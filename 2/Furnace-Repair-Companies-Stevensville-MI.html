<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay.
