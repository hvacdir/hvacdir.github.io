<p>Volatile organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from procedures or products; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

The radiators may be mounted on walls or set up within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
