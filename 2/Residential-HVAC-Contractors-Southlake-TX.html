<h3>Frequent Reasons For Air Conditioning Repair Calls in Southlake TX</h3>
<p>Particular instant results resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently challenging to determine if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
