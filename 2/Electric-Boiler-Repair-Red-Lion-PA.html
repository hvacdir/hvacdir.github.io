<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, but to have 2 major components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Because these activities generate large quantities of lead dust, individuals have actually been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint.
