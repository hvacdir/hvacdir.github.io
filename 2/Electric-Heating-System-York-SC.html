An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can pay for, numerous Seattleites need to discover ways to combat the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in big box stores like Best Buy, package fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a terrible, terrible summer.<p>
<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
