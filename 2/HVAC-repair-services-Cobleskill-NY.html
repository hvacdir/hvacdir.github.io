The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future.

Clogs can block the flow of condensed water and cause wetness accumulation within the system. Excess wetness can trigger problems like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, unequal temperature level regulation, bacteria, and jeopardized air quality. A professional maintenance technician will clean the condensate and flush drain to make sure all excess moisture flows far from the system.<p>
