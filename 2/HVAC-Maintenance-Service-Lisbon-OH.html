<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the rate fantastic but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
