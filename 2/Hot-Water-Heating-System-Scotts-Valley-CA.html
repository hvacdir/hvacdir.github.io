<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Scotts Valley CA?</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different home efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us debate which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's items and services was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the necessary electrical enhancements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it really quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
