<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions should likewise be taken to lessen contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, locals need to be alert to the emergence of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization measures need to not be undertaken until these problems have been remedied.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality problems. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
