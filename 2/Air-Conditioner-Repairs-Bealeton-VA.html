Proceed to another contractor if the one you're thinking about wants to identify the best system for your house solely on experience. Though strongly affected by where you live, a number of elements impact the size system needed, including the quantity of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and placement of doors and windows; and the orientation of your home to the sun.

<p>Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
