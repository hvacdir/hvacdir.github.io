<p>An undersize unit will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
