<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of wetness, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to supply adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
