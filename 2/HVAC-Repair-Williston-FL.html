The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
