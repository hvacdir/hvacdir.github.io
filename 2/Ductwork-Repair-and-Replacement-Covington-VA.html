<h3>Electric Heating Systems in Covington Virginia</h3>
<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been evaporated in cooling towers in standard systems.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in monthly, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
