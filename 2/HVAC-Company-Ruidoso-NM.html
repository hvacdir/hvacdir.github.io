<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
