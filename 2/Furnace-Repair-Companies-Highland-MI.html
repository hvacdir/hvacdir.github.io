<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Highland MI</h3>
<p>Another method to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside your home. Many home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants straight from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
