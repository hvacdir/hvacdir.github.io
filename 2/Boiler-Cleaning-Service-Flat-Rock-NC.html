<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
