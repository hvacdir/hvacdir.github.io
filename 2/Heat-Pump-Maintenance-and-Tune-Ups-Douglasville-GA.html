<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Douglasville GA</h3>
<p>Initially, unlike central air conditioning, you have a couple of alternatives when it comes to central heating unit. We'll jump into costs later, but you can pick from a furnace, heat or boiler  pump. In general, heaters are the most cost effective alternative.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
