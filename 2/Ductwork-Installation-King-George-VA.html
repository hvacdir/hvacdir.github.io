<h3>The Way Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your King George VA Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>Elements that can contribute to the growth of biological impurities are moist or damp structure materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners. "Humidifier fever" is a typical health problem triggered by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Different fungi and bacteria grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are animals and household plants.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
