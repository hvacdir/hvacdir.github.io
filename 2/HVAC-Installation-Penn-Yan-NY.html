<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power should not go beyond the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the very same time, given that the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Basically, the outside system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the overall power is not easy, since it considers not only the nominal power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal.

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units run independently from each other.<p>
