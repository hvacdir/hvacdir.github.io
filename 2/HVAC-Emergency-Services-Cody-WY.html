<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video footage. They use a series of computations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the area. The bigger the space, the more powerful the home heating unit needs to be. For already built home heating unit, the contractor will require to remove the old furnace to add the new one. These charges will be consisted of in the installation costs.<p>
