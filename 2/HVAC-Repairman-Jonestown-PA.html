<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace specialists typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Truth: Federal and local rewards usually total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can typically make the preliminary rate of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new building (houses typically use between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per ton. However, brand-new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the cost is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
