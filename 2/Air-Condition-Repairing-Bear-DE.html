<p>Professional heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this basic guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like ac system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This permits them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like a space heater) with the exact same quantity of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtering. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some basic maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal parts like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
