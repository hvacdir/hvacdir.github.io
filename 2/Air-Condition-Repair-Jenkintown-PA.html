<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
