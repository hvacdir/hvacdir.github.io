<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
