Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the home.<p>
