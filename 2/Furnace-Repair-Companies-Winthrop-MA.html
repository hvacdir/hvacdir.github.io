<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not offer contracts.  The so called credible companies dupe more individuals than the fly by night outfits. Due to the fact that I tried to work for them, I understand. Because 90% of them are criminals, I give up. They walk in with or without an agreement and begin offering you things you do not require.

<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperature levels in Seattle are acceptably average, you can expect a minimum of 1 month throughout which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 in 2015! Just a couple of years ago, Seattle saw a record temperature level of 103 degrees, and there have been lots of long, dry, hot streaks ever since.

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
