<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Immediate effects might show up after a single direct exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are generally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is just removing the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified. Symptoms of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise appear soon after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
