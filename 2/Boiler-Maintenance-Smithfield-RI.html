<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils.

It also prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Since a system is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that immediately raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
