<h3>How To Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Visalia CA</h3>
<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming indoors. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors remove impurities straight from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
