<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the price great however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
