Ductless heatpump are great for additions because they do not require any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Since an unit is set up in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
