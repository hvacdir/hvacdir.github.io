<h3>The Basics of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at High Ridge MO</h3>
<p>After residing in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the a/c. I went on and bought this Provider and I must say it gets the job done quite well. It takes really little time to warm up or cool off the house which is one of the important things we didnâ $ t get from the one we had previously. The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
