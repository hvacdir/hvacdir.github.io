<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively treat and solidify-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
