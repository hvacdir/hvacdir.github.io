<p>Indoor impurities. These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor pollutants.

While an area heating unit remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating system lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
