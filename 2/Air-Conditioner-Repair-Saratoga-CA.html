<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable organic substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., office equipment; wall, furnishings and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large commercial and office complex such as high-rise buildings and healthcare facilities, lorries such as cars and trucks, trains, ships, submarines and planes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with respect to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
