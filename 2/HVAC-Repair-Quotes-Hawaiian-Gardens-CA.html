<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
