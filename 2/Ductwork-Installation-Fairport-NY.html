<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Fairport NY</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need reasonably little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is important to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank should be looked for leaks, the system must be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems should be examined a minimum of two times each year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to eliminate dust collected in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
