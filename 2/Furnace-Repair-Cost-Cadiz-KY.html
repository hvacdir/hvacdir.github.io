Their techs are professional and really experienced. Costs are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser this week. I did not bother to get competitor's quotes since of my trust in Waychoff due to the fact that the cost was obviously affordable.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging long trenches or deep holes to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.

The absence of moving parts indicates you're less most likely to spend big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're substantially more efficient then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
