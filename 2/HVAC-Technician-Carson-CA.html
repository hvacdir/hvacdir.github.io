<p>Prior to you go out and purchase an ac system, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning unit? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c unit be? Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioning unit won't be able to cool the house effectively. These are simply a few of the aspects that you need to take into account when purchasing a new AC system. Each option can and will significantly affect your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to neglect any of them.<p>
<p>The primary reason homeowners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the quantity of services offered. The cost might not be worthwhile if the system is new and still under a maker's warranty. Any major repairs need to be covered under the manufacturer's guarantee. However, some producers need regular maintenance as a regard to the guarantee.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
