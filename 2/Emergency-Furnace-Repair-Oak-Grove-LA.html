<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same toxins. In other words, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Duct are responsible for distributing cold and hot air throughout your house, providing a comfy climate in every space. But ducts that are not set up appropriately or kept can disperse impurities from one space to another.

<h3>Ductless AC System in Oak Grove LA 71263</h3>
<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy needed for heating & cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, steps should likewise be taken to decrease contamination from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.) In addition, residents should be alert to the emergence of signs of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization procedures need to not be undertaken up until these issues have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of contamination that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can pay for, many Seattleites should discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are snatched up as soon as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the reality of a vicious, harsh summer season.<p>
<p>Start by checking out the installation handbook and familiarizing yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Most systems include a set that includes adjustable window extensions and metal installing brackets. These parts will make sure a protected and airtight  fit in the window opening. And for extra assistance, especially for larger a/c unit, consider buying a steel support bracket and install it to the outdoors home wall, straight below the windowsill.<p>
