<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
