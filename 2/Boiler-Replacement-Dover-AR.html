<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for consultation and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on numerous factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether a person responds to a contaminant depends on individual level of sensitivity, which varies enormously from person to person. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>A SEER score represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER ranking of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the same period. Basically, SEER offers more data based on how the EER performs in different temps. The higher the unit's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER score can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all devices.<p>

You'll have a water leakage if your HVAC unit is not draining appropriately. A limitation in your drainage pipelines triggers a water leak. There are several places a clog can take place. Among the main areas where clogs begin to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Different HVAC contractors might differ their service offering a little in a different way from other companies.
