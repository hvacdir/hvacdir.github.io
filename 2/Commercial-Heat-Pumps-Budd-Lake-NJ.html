<p>Heating is the biggest energy expenditure in the typical home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water.

The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
