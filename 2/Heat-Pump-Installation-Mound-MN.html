<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
