<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
