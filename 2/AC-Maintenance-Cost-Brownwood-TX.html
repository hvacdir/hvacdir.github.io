<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
