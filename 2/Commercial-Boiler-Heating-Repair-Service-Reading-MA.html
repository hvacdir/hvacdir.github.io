<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is typically vital to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such information can sometimes be acquired by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If keeping track of information is not available, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent need to request that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Review of this data might recognize possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
