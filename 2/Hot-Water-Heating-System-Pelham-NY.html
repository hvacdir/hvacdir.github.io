<p>We suggest using our insulation boards when installing over concrete pieces. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when used in combination with underfloor heating by functioning as a really efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece below.
