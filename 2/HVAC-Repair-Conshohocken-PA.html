<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>

Only be worried if your house is not heating up. However, if your system does not seem working appropriately, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you ought to hire a professional to check and repair the unit.<p>
