Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By comparison, checking and replacing a furnace filter can usually be done in just a few minutes, frequently with no tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Irritants are materials that cause an immune-type reaction in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Irritants found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being air-borne, and thus, are easily breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the existence of cat irritant could bring on an asthma attack in people with cat allergies, however not in those individuals who do not have feline allergies.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can become airborne when it dries. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
