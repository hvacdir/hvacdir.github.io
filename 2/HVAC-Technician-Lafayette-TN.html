A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, go to Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
