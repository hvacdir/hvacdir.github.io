<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Contractors in Fort Smith</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the a/c unit increase. This increase has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The ac system's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
