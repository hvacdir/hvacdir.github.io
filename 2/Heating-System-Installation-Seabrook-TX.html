<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and used clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
