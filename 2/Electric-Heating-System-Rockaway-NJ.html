<h3>Electric Heating in Rockaway New Jersey</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have two significant components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
