<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>A specialized air conditioner that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard ac system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the very same air course. Since its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, since all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same room, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is actually warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
