<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like air conditioning unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a home.

Underground temperature stays constant no matter the environment, so geothermal systems offer consistent and trustworthy heating and cooling.<p>
<p>Reinstall the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Turn on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and wait for the AC to start (see Be Patient at Start-up," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan should spin.
