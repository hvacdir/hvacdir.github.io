<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance.

After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
