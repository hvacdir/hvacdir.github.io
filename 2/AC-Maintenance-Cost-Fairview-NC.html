<p>Through normal use and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioner may become extremely filthy. These aspects of the equipment are important for efficient air conditioning. The technician cleans all parts, and inspects connections to guarantee they are safe. The unit is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for proper function and general condition. This is an outstanding opportunity to recognize parts that are worn or faulty. Changing them to fix the cooling might be a lot cheaper when the problem is fairly small.<p>
<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly harden and treat-- generally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
