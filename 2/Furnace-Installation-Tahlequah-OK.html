<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
