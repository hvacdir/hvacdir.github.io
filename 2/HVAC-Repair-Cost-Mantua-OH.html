<p>Chemical contaminants: Volatile natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and common. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; wall, furniture and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) accidental spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
<p>With the cost of electrical power and gas increasing, it's important to have your furnace tuned-up for maximum energy cost savings. This will keep you from unnecessarily paying more than you should. Paragon Heating & House Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Examination of your furnace includes a Performance Check-Up, in which the thermostat is looked for accuracy and the burners are changed for optimal efficiency. Apotheosis Heating & Home Comfort Solutions DOES NOT use the ineffective 'eyeball the flame' technique that other companies utilize. Rather, the combustion is optimized by measuring the exhaust gasses and making scientific adjustments. This alone might pay for the entire maintenance visit at today's cost of gas.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to provide enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
