When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to construct the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner must strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
