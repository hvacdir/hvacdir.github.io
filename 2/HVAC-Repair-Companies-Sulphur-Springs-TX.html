<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the go to. They recommended replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working.

<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the evaporator, compressor, and condenser are all located in one cabinet, which typically is placed on a roofing system or on a concrete piece next to the house's structure. This type of air conditioning unit also is used in small commercial structures. Air supply and return ducts originate from indoors through the house's outside wall or roof to connect with the packaged a/c unit, which is generally situated outdoors.
