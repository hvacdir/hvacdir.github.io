<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s below the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>

<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems at Lawrenceburg TN - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in house building and construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in roofs, floors, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
