<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
