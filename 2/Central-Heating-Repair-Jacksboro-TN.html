<p>Proper ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet includes the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet consists of the evaporator. In many split-system air conditioning unit, this indoor cabinet likewise contains a furnace or the indoor part of a heatpump.

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperature levels in Seattle are acceptably typical, you can expect a minimum of 30 days throughout which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees.
