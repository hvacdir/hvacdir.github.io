Numerous common building materials used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Typically, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure materials are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building renovation.
