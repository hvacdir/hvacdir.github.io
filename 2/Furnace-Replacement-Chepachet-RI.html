<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Relying on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures discovered simply a couple of feet below ground. In the summer months, the process reverses, thus cooling a home by getting rid of heat. Underground temperature level remains consistent no matter the climate, so geothermal systems provide consistent and trusted heating and cooling.<p>
