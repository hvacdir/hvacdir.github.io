PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While space air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
