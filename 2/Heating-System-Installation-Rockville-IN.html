The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>

A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>

Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
