<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
