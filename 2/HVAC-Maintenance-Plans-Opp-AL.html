<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
