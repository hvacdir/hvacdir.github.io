<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
