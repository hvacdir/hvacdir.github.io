<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to speak to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a house heating system, you might search for a heatpump more geared toward cooling capacity and efficiency.
