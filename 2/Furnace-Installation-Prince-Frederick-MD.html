<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with two local companies for bids. While both were informative and valuable, Ballard Natural Gas gave us a better offer, for extraordinary service. Instead of an easy sales task, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heating system and situated methods we might have more even heat. He included these minor but considerable modifications in his quote. We chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heatpump since of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological reasons.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
