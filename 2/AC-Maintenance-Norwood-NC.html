<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

The 2 operations use various processes, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated up to boiling point to attain its aims.<p>
