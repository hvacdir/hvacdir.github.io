<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
