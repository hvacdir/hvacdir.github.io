<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not provide car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
