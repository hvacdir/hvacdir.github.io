<h3>Average HVAC Services Offered with a Chico CA HVAC Company</h3>
<p>One of the primary factors a furnace will run continuously is because something is filthy or stopped up Prior to trying to fix any issue, take some time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is great to go, examine the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lube it. If you still can not find out why your furnace keeps running, get in touch with a skilled technician.<p>

That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down prior to it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
