<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the go to. They advised replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
