<p>Healthcare facility operating theatres, in which air is filtered to high levels to minimize infection danger and the humidity controlled to restrict patient dehydration. Although temperature levels are typically in the comfort variety, some professional procedures, such as open heart surgical treatment, need low temperature levels (about 18 ° C, 64 ° F) and others, such as neonatal, fairly heats (about 28 ° C, 82 ° F). In both comfort and procedure applications, the goal may be to not just control temperature level, but also humidity, air quality, and air movement from space to area.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
