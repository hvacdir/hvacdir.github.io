<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a range of sources; the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined structure materials, furnishings, and mold as serious issues, but much of the danger also comes from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big concern in the developing world.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might see moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, talk with your doctor about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
