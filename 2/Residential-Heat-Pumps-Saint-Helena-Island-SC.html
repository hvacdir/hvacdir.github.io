<h3>Solar Heating System in Saint Helena Island SC 29920</h3>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
