<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting info on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>
