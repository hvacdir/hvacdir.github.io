<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up.
