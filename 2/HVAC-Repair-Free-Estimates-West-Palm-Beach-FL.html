<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the appropriate temperature level. Heaters that kick on frequently might be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
