<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
