<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to provide sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
