<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
