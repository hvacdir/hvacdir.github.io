<h3>How to Get the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Dayton OH</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really pleased that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to test the a/c before you purchase.

<p>Do not stress! Your Nest thermostat is still ok; it just may need 24 volts of electrical power. The Nest thermostat requires 24 volts of low voltage supplied by your transformer to keep the digital display screen on. If 24 volts isn't gotten, you'll get a blank screen. There are many different reasons your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be going over why you might be having trouble with your Nest smart thermostat. Check your emergency breakers first. You must have the right amount of high voltage going to your furnace. Inspect if you have the appropriate 120 volts of power going to the furnace. Often the furnace switch is unintentionally turned off by someone going up in the attic. There is a furnace switch that in some cases goes faulty. It looks like a light switch in the attic. There are many wires in your furnace.<p>
