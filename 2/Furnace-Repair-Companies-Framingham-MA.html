<p>The function of most building ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing safety at affordable energy costs. Load computing is referred to as the Manual J estimation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or system cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square video alone. Just like measuring the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the correct size of system for your home also depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
