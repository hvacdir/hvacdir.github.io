<h3>Common Causes of Air Conditioning Repair Calls in West Roxbury MA</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the consistent heat circulation over the entire surface area of a floor heats up the lower half of the space, enveloping inhabitants in warmth at a lower overall temperature-- sometimes approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating unit." Simply put, in-floor heating systems provide a different mode and level of convenience. And, as different public awareness campaigns have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn reducing our energy expenses.<p>
