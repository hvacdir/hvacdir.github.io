<p>We're spending a lot more time inside, nowadays. While many people presume contamination is simply an outside issue, your home (and workplace) can also be polluted. As a society, we ensure that our houses are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we don't think adequate about direct exposure to all the things we place in our houses," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a big result on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea-- right away, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe much easier.<p>
