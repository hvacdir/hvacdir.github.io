Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
