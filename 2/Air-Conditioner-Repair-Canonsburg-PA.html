<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a correctly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run because it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
