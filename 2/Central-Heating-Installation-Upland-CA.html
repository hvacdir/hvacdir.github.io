Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high indoors might cause occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are usually 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in most structures. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>

<p>Immediate results might show up after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate impacts are treatable and normally short-term. Sometimes the treatment is simply removing the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also show up soon after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside your home and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>HVAC is an abbreviation for Ventilation, air and heating Conditioning, and refers to the environment control systems installed in homes or commercial homes.
