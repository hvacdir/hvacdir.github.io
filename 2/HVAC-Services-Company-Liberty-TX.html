<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these contaminants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful irritant. It can become airborne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
