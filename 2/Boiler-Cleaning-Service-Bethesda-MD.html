<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer season air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>We have been extremely happy with Stability's equipment (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has worked very well and is so effective that it considerably lowered our energy expenses - the system will spend for itself in less than 5 years. The few times we require them for emergency situations they reacted quickly and fixed the problem.<p>
