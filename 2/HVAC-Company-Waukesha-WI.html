Location the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing product to protect it from damage.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
