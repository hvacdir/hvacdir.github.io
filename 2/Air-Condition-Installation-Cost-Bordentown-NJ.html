<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
