<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am very impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years back and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
