<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up just a couple of years earlier.<p>

<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may discover moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
