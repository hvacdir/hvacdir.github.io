<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to two days might end up being a source for mold development and should be disposed of. Sometimes there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in covert or hardly ever accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely tidy the area utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
