<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very valuable in gathering info on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and used clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
