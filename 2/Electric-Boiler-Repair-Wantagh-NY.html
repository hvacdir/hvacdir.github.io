<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay products. Because they just partially remove the radon decay products and do not lessen the quantity of radon going into the home, the effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a trustworthy means of decreasing the health danger from radon. EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers more info on air-cleaning gadgets to minimize indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office complex such as medical facilities and skyscrapers, automobiles such as cars, trains, aircrafts, submarines and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with regard to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Contagious diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of illness caused by biological toxins include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and digestive issues.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might position risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
