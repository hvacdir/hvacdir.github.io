<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>

<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to individual bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
