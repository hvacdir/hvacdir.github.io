Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning system (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While room cooling offers maximum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more expensive than central air.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Southern Pines NC</h3>

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
