<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
