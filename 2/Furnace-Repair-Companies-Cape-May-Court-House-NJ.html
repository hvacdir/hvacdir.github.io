<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Cape May Court House NJ</h3>
<p>Convected heat systems are significantly popular, particularly in the past quarter-century as technology has actually advanced, and the systems have proven themselves in dependability and economy.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
