<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure.
