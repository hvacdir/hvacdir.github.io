Their techs are expert and really well-informed. Costs are affordable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser today.

<p>Inspect these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
