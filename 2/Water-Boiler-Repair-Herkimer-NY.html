<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
