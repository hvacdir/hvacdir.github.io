In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
