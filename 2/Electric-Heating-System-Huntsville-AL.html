<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are prone to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot beside the radiators.
