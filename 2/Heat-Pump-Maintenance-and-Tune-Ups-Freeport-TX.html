<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Installation in Freeport Texas</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Dripping return ducts can likewise present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Most people do not recognize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break over time. That can compromise the performance of the system and eventually damage it enough that you require to purchase furnace replacement or AC replacement. The maintenance technician will carefully examine the connections and assess the performance of the system. They'll look for torn and damaged wires and replace them in order to minimize the threat of fire and component failure.<p>
