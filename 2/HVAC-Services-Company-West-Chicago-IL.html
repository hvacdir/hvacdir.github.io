<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
