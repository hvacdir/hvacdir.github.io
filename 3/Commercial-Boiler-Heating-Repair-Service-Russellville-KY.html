In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>

You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take control of when temperature levels reach freezing.
