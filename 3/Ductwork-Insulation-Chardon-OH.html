<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for performance. Older systems from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. If you are including on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite costly.<p>
