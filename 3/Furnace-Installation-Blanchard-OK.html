<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
