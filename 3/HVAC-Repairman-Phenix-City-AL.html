<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
