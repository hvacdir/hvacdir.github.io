<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing.

In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
