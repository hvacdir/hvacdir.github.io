<p>Additionally, tidy and even vacuum repeatedly in the location where your heater is situated. Although you might think that emptying the room of all items that may ignite at some point provides sufficient safety, often other junk such as lint and dust might gather inside the furnace which may cause a fire. Too much lint and dust will also obstruct your filter earlier than it need to be which will be a blow to your budget as you will need to repair or replace the equipment.<p>
<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we suggest utilizing our insulation boards.
