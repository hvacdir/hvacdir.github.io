<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood products used adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor usage consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops).

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them till they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>

The heat can be moved to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be installed on walls or set up within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
