<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Camas Washington</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, stored fuels and paint materials, and vehicle emissions in connected garages. Actions that will decrease benzene exposure consist of getting rid of cigarette smoking within the house, attending to maximum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint supplies and special fuels that will not be used right away.<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "regular" occupational exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to determine if the general indoor air quality satisfies a certain standard. Occupational exposure limits noted in health and safety policies and the Threshold Limitation Worths ® (TLVs) suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are intended as a guide to avoid health problem or specific results (like eye and nose irritation) in industrial scenarios. These limits may not be appropriate in office settings or for the home.<p>
