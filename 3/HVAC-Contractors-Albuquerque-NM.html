<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated delay features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
