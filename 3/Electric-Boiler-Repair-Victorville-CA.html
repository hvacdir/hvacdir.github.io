<p>Sean was very practical. He is a really pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to buy additional stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor.
