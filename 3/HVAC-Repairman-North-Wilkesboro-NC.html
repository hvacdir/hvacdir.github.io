<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that might impact the health of individuals who live in the house. Contaminants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering your house from the ground listed below. An air toxin might also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on moist or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care items. Bacteria and infections, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place with time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
