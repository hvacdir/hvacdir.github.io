<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
