<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not use agreements.  The so called respectable companies rip off more individuals than the fly by night attire. I know because I attempted to work for them. I stop because 90% of them are crooks. They walk in with or without an agreement and begin selling you things you do not need. They lie. How do I know. I now work as a specialist to validate the so called problems and solutions. 9 out of 10, I inspect are completely incorrect.<p>
