<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
