<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near your house as possible per my request.

<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Maintenance in Clackamas OR 97015</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
