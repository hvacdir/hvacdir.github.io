<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of changing or exchanging air in any area to offer high indoor air quality which includes temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes unpleasant smells and extreme wetness, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior building air flowing, and prevents stagnancy of the interior air.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the whole surface area of a flooring warms the lower half of the room, enveloping inhabitants in heat at a lower general temperature-- in some cases approximately 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heating unit."
