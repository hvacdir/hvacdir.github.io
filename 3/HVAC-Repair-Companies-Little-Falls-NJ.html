<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for many years. However if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel expenses all of a sudden seem greater than regular, it is probably time to consider a brand-new system.

Since an unit is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you exist.<p>
