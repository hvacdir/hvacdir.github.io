<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit.

We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
