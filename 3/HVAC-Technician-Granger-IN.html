Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace also.

<h3>Central Heating Installation Service in Granger IN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
