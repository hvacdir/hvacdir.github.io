<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
