Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them till they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
