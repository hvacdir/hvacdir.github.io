<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
