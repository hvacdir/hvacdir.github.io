<p>We take a look at hints before we supply advice to replace rather than repair a heating system. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher every year, we know the unit is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more efficient model, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you do identify an especially energy-efficient in-floor heating system and select to install it in your home, you might be qualified for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor costs. (And these expenses can be substantial.

Seek Advice From the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Resource (DSIRE) to see if there are refunds, loans or tax reductions available for the installation of a more efficient in-floor heating unit where you live.<p>
