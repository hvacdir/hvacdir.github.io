<p>To say there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set package in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s below package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were very popular in the first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial structures, apartment buildings and huge homes. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, since the absence of moving parts makes them less prone to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
