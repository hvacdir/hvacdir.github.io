<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements.

<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
