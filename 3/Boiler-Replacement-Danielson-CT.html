<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
