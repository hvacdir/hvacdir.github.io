<p>Next, and maybe just as essential when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for residence occupants. Unlike other types of a/c unit, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be transported through cooler pads that cool the air prior to it reaches the inside of a house through its duct system; this cooled outside air must be enabled to press the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically easy to understand and preserve.<p>
