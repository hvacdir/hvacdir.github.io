Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been connected to signs like headaches, fatigue, problem concentrating, and irritation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs.

In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger instant signs however can lead to cancer after many years.<p>
<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. A ductless system has a built-in effectiveness benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions because they don't require any new ductwork to be set up. Since an unit is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
