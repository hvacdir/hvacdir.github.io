<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a harmful environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary ecological danger to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how damaging lead could be, it was used in paint, fuel, water pipes, and numerous other products.<p>
<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a range of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually identified building materials, furnishings, and mold as serious issues, but much of the risk also originates from burning things. For instance, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop contamination in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is an especially big problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. Once the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and solidify-- normally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
