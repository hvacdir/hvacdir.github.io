<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s below package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
