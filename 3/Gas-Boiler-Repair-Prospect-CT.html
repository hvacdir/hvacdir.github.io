<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
