<p>Chemical contaminants: Volatile organic substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are various, differed, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items used in the structure (e.g., office equipment; wall, furnishings and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off pollutants.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
