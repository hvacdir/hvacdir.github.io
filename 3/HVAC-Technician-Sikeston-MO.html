<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be developed when lead-based paint is incorrectly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning.

<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are also referred to as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed individually.
