<p>A geothermal heat pump is likewise a really safe heating and cooling service, because it does not require any sort of combustion, unlike alternatives. This makes the WaterFurnace geothermal system a better option for those who are worried about security, both in terms of individuals and the environment, with geothermal services offering an environment-friendly energy source for heating and cooling houses.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
