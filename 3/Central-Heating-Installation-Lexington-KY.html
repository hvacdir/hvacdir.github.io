<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
