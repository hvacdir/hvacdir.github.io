<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
