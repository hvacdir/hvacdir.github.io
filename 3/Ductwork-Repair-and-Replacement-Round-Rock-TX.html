<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a skilled HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the tools or abilities necessary to check refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are important to a well-functioning system, however property owners lack the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician check the system regularly.<p>
<p>When your house's furnace quits working, your house can have more problems than just being unpleasant.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
