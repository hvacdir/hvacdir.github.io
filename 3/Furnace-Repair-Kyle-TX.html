<p>Immediate results might show up after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are usually short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is just getting rid of the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may likewise show up not long after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>While pollutants typically discovered in indoor air are responsible for many harmful results, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are necessary to produce particular illness. People likewise react extremely differently to direct exposure to indoor air toxins. Additional research is needed to better understand which health impacts happen after exposure to the typical pollutant concentrations discovered in homes and which take place from the greater concentrations that occur for brief amount of times.<p>
<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often important to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Review of this information may recognize potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping track of information might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
