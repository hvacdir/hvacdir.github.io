<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every three months. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>
