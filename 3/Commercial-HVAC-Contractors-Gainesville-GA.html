Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as simply glowing systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
