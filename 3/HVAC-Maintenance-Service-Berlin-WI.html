<h3>Hot Water Heating System in Berlin Wisconsin</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and effectively, however to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to decide whether your home may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air contamination. Finally, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can indicate your house may not have sufficient ventilation consist of wetness condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To detect odors in your house, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether odors are visible.<p>
