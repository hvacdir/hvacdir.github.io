<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the efficiency and efficiency of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor wisely, much of the 'trusted' contractors touted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
