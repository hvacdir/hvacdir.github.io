Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as simply radiant systems.

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
