<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources may not posture a significant health danger on their own, a lot of homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a severe danger from the cumulative results of these sources. Luckily, there are actions that many people can take both to lower the risk from existing sources and to avoid brand-new problems from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can minimize the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
