<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
