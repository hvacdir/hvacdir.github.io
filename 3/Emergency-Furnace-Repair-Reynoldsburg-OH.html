All the damp hot air that passes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the space that is being cooled. If your HVAC unit is not draining properly, you'll have a water leakage. A constraint in your drain pipes causes a water leak. There are various locations a blockage can take place. One of the primary locations where blockages begin to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
