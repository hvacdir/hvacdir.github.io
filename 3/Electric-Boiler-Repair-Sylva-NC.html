<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heat pump While room air conditioning supplies optimum versatility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
