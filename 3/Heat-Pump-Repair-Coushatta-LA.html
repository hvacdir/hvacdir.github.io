<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the condenser, evaporator, and compressor are all situated in one cabinet, which normally is put on a roofing system or on a concrete slab beside the house's structure.

Packaged air conditioning system typically consist of electric heating coils or a natural gas furnace.

<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Coushatta LA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

If this happens, your thermostat will shut off the furnace prematurely and leave your house feeling cold. You may also require to examine your insulation to make sure that warm air does not leave from your space through numerous openings.<p>
