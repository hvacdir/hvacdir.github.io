<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals.

Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to reduce your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them until they have been correctly dried. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent gos to, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
