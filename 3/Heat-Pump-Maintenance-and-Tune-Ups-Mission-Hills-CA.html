<p>All heating unit have some level of air purification. From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne contaminants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>

Toxins could come from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in your house from the ground below. An air toxin could likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care items. Viruses and germs, animal dander, and pest parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>

In kitchens and bathrooms, mold and mildew can end up being a nuisance where wetness levels are typically higher than in the rest of your house.<p>
