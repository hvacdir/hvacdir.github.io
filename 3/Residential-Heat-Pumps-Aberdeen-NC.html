<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by providing a professional quote with options, without pressing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
