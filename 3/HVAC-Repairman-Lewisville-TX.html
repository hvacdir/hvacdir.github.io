<p>Biological pollutants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
