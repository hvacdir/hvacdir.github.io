<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with regular preventive maintenance, however, there will constantly be the odd problem that periodically shows up. It is very crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible when you do observe your furnace acting strangely. The faster you react to issues with your furnace, the easier they are to fix. Waiting to require repairs will just make the problem worse, and often more costly.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
