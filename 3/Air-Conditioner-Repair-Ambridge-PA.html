<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in Ambridge Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Some HVAC technicians offer service contracts to their customers, supplying regular maintenance of heating and cooling systems. In some circumstances, other tradespeople will work with HVAC techs to assist set up or repair cooling and heating unit.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
