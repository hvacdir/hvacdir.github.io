<p>A health questionnaire ought to be developed and dispersed to all worried employees. Such a tool must determine the number of people impacted; define ages and job descriptions of involved workers; determine where they lie within the office; show when the signs occur (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of particular health signs or health problems; identify all machines run in the work environment; indicate the kind of outdoors air pollution; and identify potential sources of job tension.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 need to be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>
