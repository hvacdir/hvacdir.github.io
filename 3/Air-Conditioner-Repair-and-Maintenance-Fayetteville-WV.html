<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Fayetteville WV 25840</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what products 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer malfunctions, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
