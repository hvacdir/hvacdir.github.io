For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.

Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been appropriately dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. Try a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
