<p>We got in touch with Elite HVACS on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate scenario & chose to go with them for the work. I more than happy to say that not only did we get the central air conditioning going but likewise replaced the heating unit which was old.
