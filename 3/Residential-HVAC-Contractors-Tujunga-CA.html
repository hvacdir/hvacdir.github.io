<p>The first a/c and fridges used flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that might result in deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends changing your filter once every three months. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
