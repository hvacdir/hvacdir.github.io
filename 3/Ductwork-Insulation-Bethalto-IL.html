<h3>Immediate Purchase HVAC Equipment at Bethalto IL</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are extremely efficient, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a continuous temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Just like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal performance ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (COP). POLICE rates how much heat a system produces or removes (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling effect. A lot of ground source heat pumps have Polices of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for each unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, roughly 3 to 5 units are provided back in the kind of heat.<p>
