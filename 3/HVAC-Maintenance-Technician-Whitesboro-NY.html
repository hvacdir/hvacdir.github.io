Nevertheless, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible in many cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
