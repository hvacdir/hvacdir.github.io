We utilized the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets.
