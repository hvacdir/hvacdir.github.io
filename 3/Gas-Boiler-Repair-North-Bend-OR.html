Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the expected amount of time. post install inspection results look very good for braising and pipes quality.
