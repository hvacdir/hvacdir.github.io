<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer car debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
