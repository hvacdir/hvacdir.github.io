<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
