<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
<p>Through normal use and the system's existence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioning unit might become very dirty.
