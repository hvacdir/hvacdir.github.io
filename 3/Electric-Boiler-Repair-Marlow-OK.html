<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Marlow OK?</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We selected getting something more costly than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our greatest energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
