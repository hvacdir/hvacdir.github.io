<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system air conditioning", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floors, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it distributes through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
