Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal convenience inside. However, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for careful attention to humidity levels inside.
