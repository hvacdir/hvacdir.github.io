This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space air conditioning offers optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
