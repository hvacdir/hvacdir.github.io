<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault.

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
