<p>EER means Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air units is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly solidify and cure-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
