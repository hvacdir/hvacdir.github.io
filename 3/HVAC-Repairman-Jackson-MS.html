Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
