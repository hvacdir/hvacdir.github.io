It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>

These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions call for.

Furthermore, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
