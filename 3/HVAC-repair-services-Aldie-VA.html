Today's heating systems are ranked 90% efficiency or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective.

On all calls, we also do an extensive security examination to make sure that your furnace is safe from hazards like gas leaks, carbon monoxide gas leakages, and other potential threats in your house.

This makes a geothermal heating system an attractive solution to cut your carbon footprint, providing a positive influence on the environment.<p>
<p>A/c can create a lot of water since they remove moisture from the air. To eliminate this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In fact, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can likewise puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
