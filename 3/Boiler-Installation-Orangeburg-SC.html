<p>Around The Clock A/c is as promised: available right away to offer excellent service. Ilan Cohavi, the owner, works neatly and efficiently to deliver a completed project in record time. He set up 3 Nest Learning Thermostats in my house. His understanding of the product was outstanding. His craftsmanship was excellent and he didn't leave a mess. The benefit: he is a very enjoyable person to deal with, and is very eager to finish the work based on the specifications of his client. I would highly advise him for all your HVAC needs.<p>
<p>The primary reason property owners do not purchase an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 each year, depending on the amount of services offered. If the system is new and still under a maker's service warranty, the cost might not be rewarding. Any significant repairs should be covered under the maker's warranty. However, some manufacturers require routine maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
