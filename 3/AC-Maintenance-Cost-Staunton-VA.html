<h3>Advantages of Professional AC Repair in Staunton VA</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in home building is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, floors, and roofings. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Staunton VA 24401</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. When they are managed in a way that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled, these products present a threat only. When asbestos-containing materials are harmed or disrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being airborne if proper controls are not in place. This can result in the potential for considerable illness.<p>
