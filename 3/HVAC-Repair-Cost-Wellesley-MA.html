<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer.

<p>When installing radiant heat, you must provide serious thought to the type of floor covering in the house. Ceramic tile works well since it performs and stores heat. Wood, vinyl and linoleum are less efficient, but work fairly well. Carpeting will directly insulate the floor from the space, reducing effectiveness, so if you want to install carpet in a radiant-heated room, utilize a thin carpet with dense cushioning.<p>
