<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power ought to not go beyond the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not simple, considering that it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
