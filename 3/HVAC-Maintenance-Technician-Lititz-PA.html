On those days when you simply can't appear to heat up and discover you need to turn up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses pulsating.

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
