When it does require to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to install.

For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could bring on an asthma attack in individuals with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
