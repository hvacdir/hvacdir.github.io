These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. In addition, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
