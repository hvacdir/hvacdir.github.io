<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in home building is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in floorings, roofing systems, and walls. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>
