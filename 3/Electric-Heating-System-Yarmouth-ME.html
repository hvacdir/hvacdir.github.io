<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most budget friendly if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide should be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
