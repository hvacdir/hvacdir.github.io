<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
