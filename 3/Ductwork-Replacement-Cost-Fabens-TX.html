<p>I'll begin with a natural gas furnace because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency.

If your home currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be quite costly if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
