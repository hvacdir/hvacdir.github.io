Heaters that kick on often may be because of a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
