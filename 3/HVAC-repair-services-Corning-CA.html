<h3>Ductwork Cleaning in Corning California</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the see. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.
