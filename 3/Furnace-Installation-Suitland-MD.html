<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
