<h3>AC Maintenance in Whitsett NC 27377</h3>
<p>Geothermal heating is among the most effective heating sources in terms of environmental costs. Because the energy utilized to heat your home is drawn out directly from the ground, it secures the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or contaminants. Geothermal systems utilize compressor and evaporator systems comparable to those used in fridges. While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical power, they release far fewer greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heater that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>I am changing our High Speed System because of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not release heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
