<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Floyd VA Home Owners</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while all at once eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to state, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is indoors or outdoors - can make it increasingly hard for your lungs to operate effectively, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
