<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may end up being clogged, lowering air flow quality, volume, and distribution. They likewise may end up being locations for germs and molds to grow and be distributed throughout the home.

<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to transfer the heat to the spaces. Most contemporary hot water boiler heating systems have a circulator, which is a pump, to move warm water through the circulation system (as opposed to older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be moved to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, warm water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators may be installed on walls or installed within the flooring to produce floor heat.<p>
