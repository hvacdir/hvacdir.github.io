<h3>Home Air Conditioning Service in Stockton CA 95206</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it means the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>They were terrific! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They satisfied my requirements entirely by offering a professional quote with choices, without pressing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and finished a little early. The also immediately followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely advise this company.<p>
<p>Consider a whole house dehumidifier if your single stage air conditioner isn't old enough to justify replacement. By setting up dehumidification devices inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy some of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, enhancing indoor air quality and allowing higher comfort at greater temperature levels.<p>
