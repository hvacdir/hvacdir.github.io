There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
