<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is likewise a choice for house owners to think about. Many times, these systems include not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system independently, given that the system is combined.
