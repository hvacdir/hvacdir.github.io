<p>If you think a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>When our furnace was passing away, we contacted two local companies for bids. While both were useful and practical, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a much better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and situated ways we might have more even heat. He included these considerable but small adjustments in his quote. We chose to alter from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of recent warmer summertimes and for environmental reasons.<p>
<p>What happens when you have an emergency? The first reaction of many people is to panic.
