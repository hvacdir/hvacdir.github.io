<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion objective.
