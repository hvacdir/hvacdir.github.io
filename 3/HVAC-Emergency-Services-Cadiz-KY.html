<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature indicates. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
