A/c help to dehumidify the inbound air, however in very damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning unit is large, it may not attain a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c will require more energy to cool your house. A more effective alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
