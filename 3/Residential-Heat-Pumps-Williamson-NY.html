<p>Frequently, indoor air quality issues in large commercial structures can not be efficiently recognized or fixed without a comprehensive building investigation. These investigations may begin with written surveys and telephone assessments in which building private investigators examine the history of resident signs and structure operation treatments. Sometimes, these questions may quickly reveal the issue and on-site check outs are unneeded.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
