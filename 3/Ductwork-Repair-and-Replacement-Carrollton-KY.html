When the temperature level falls listed below a limit, both the fan and compressor are shut off to alleviate more temperature level drops; clarification required this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the space. citation required When the temperature rises again, clarification needed the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed.<p>
