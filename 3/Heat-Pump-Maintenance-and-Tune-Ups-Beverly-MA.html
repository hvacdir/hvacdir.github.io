<p>EHSI's indoor air quality group excels in integrating a multidisciplinary technique to indoor air quality (IAQ) challenges. When estimating the cost of an installation, a safe cost estimate bracket is between $10 to $20 per square foot dependant on the type of system you choose for your home. Installation aside, you will still need to call out a qualified electrical expert to connect the system to your power supply, this may take a few hours and can cost anything between $200 and $250 dependant on who you choose and where you live.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
