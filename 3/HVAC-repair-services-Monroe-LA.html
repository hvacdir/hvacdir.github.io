<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
