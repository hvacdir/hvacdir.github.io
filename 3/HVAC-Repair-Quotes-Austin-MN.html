The technician invested a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
