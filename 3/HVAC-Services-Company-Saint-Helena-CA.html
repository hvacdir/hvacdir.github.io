<p>Indoor air quality (likewise called "indoor environmental quality") describes how within air can impact a person's convenience, health, and ability to work. It can consist of temperature, humidity, lack of outside air (poor ventilation), mold from water damage, or direct exposure to other chemicals.

<p>A lot of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
