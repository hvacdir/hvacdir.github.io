This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
