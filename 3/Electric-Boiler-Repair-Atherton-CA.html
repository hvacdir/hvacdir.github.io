<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the average home. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>

What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back.

We were referred by a family good friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
