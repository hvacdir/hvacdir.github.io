<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions call for.

Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow.

<h3>AC Unit Repair in Chico CA 95926</h3>
<p>We needed 2 visits - Jake came out first and was extremely educated and pleasant and courteous. Grant came out a couple days later and was nice and also experienced to talk with. They both did a fantastic job. Sabre's workplace personnel is very helpful, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and offering the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are likewise well priced for their services. Definitely advise.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A great location to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one aspect (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
