<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. Additionally, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically hard to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioning unit don't just break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repeated use of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature wear and tear, resulting in holes and cracks. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.  a really beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
