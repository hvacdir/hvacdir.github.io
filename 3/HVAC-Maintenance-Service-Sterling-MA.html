<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, considering that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
