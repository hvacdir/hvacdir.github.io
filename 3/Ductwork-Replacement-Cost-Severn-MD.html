<h3>The Way to Get Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Severn MD</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Ensure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
