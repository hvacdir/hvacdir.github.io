<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices normally lasts decades, because it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to install.

In the past, some poorly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to work.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
