<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows finest in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which may enter close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
