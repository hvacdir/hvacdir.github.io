<p>Your air, heating, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the possible to adversely affect your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and really little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if needed, upgrade the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and fractures in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating expenses.
