<p>Although installation is simple and does not need much time, attempting this task is not an excellent concept.

<p>In most cases, if materials have stopped working to dry out a number of days after the presumed water event, mold growth is believed within wall cavities even if it is not immediately noticeable. Through a mold examination, which might include damaging inspection, one must have the ability to figure out the existence or lack of mold.
