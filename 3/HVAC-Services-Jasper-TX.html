Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
