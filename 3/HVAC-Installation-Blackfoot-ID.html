<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite.

<p>Central air is a high-end not everybody can manage, numerous Seattleites must find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in big box shops like Finest Buy, package fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the country to deal with the reality of a harsh, terrible summer.<p>
