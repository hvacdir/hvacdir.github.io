<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
