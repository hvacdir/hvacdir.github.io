<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Antioch CA</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipelines set up under the floor or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with strong mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and individuals. It does not count on heating or moving air to transfer heat.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
