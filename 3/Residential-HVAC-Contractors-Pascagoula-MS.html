The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to find out how to get the water evaluated. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place gradually due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
