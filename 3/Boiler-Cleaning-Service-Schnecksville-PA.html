<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not know why their HVAC unit is not working. American Standard air conditioning system are one of the very best central air conditioning brands in business. The average cost to install a 14 SEER American Standard AC unit would be around $2,600 to $3,200. The company gets far less repair requires its' AC systems than most of the other AC units in business.

<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to use. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we fixed problems.
