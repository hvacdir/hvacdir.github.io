<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."
