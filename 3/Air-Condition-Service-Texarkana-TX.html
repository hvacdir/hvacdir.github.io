<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also regulating the temperature level of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Though it may be tough to believe, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your home, but there are numerous other pollutants that can not just dirty up the air, however lead to other health complications.
