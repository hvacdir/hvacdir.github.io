<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have actually been around given that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floorings and tied them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and an elementary pumping machine to flow warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the flooring heat moved heat to other short articles in the rooms, including the human residents.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.
