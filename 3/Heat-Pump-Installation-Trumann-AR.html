<h3>Repair and Care for Trumann AR Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
