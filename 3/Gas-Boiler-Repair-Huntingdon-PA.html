<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Huntingdon PA 16652</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle a/c unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit likewise switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
