<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is generally greater than many heat pump choices, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the model you purchase. One of the primary advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to greater temperature levels than other heating choices. This indicates it can warm up your home to the preferred temperature level quicker than a heat pump can.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
