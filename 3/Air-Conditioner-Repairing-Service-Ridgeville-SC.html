<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
