Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>

<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance at Coloma MI</h3>
<p>The icing problem ends up being far more severe with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are commonly set up in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heating unit, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized instead of the heatpump throughout harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
