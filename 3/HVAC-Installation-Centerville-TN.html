<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Lastly, if you do identify a particularly energy-efficient in-floor heating system and pick to install it in your home, you might be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor expenses. (And these costs can be considerable. According to figures gathered by Angie's List, house owners can anticipate to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not consisting of tax and labor, for a radiant heating system.) Speak With the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Incentives for Renewable Resource (DSIRE) to see if there are rebates, loans or tax reductions available for the installation of a more effective in-floor heater where you live.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
