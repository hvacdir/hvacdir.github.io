<h3>Heating System Installation in Rockland Maine</h3>
<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 significant components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house occupants.
