As an initial step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Before you go out and buy an a/c, there are a couple of things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the a/c unit? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioner be? Too large and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can harm the a/c and reduce its life. Too little and your air conditioner won't be able to cool your home effectively. These are just a few of the factors that you require to take into account when buying a brand-new AC system. Each choice can and will substantially impact your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to disregard any of them.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact related to direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
