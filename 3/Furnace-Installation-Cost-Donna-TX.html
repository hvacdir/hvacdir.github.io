Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each room. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
