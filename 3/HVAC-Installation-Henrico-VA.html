<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
