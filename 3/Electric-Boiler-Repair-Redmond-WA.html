<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My other half stated that she had actually seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, however I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the best, most decent people I have met in a very long time.
