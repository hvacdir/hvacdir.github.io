<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Milan MI 48160</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Manufacturers warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they diagnosed the concern and fixed extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, however lots of utilize the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a better option. If the current system has actually not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that led to the breakdown can be determined and remedied, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
