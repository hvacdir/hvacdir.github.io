<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor system as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
