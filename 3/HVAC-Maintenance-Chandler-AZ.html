<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services in Chandler AZ</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
