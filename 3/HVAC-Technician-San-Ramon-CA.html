<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For San Ramon CA Home Owners</h3>
<p>Lots of Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that deals with indoor air quality concerns. In the absence of such legislation, the "general duty clause" uses.

Therefore, ensuring the air is of great quality is the company's duty.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
