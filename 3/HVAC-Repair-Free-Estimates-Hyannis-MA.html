<p>There is no simple answer, but many use the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is most likely a better solution. If the current system has actually not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise exceptional condition, and problems that resulted in the breakdown can be recognized and fixed, repairing the system can make a great deal of sense also.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system cooling", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the ceilings, floors, or walls covered by grills) bring cooled air from the a/c unit to the home. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
