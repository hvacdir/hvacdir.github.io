<p>Another technique to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outside air coming inside your home. Most house heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that exhaust outdoors remove impurities directly from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
