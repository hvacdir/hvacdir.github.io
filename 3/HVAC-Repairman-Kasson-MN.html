While contaminants commonly discovered in indoor air can cause numerous harmful impacts, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are required to produce specific health problems.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>Geothermal cooling is a affordable and wise way to cool off your house or workplace when the temperature levels keep climbing.

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
