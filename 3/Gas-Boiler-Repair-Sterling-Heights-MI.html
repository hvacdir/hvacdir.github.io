<p>Instant discounts on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are offered to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or supplier point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Support! Environment Pro is dependable and genuinely appreciated us and our situation. We got back one night to a cold home. I called Climate Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he adjusted his schedule so he could try to find and acquire it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely happy to have a heated house again. What's most amazing was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to help us right prior to a vacation, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my good friends.<p>

<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Many people do not understand how humidity is removed from your Houston Midtown Tx house. The evaporator HVAC coil in your attic also acts a dehumidifier. All the moist hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the area that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining correctly, you'll have a water leak. A restriction in your drainage pipelines triggers a water leakage. There are various places a blockage can occur. Among the primary areas where blockages start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
