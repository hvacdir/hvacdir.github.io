My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working.

<p>Stability Energy fasted to react when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our two furnaces were not working. They showed up the next day and replaced 2 heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the new heating systems can heat the house.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
