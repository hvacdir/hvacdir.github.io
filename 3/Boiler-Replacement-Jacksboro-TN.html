<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might observe undesirable or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues.

<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing system, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise a choice for property owners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning unit itself however likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, since the unit is integrated.

For that reason, this might not be the very best option for property owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
