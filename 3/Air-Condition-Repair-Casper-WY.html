This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heatpump While space cooling supplies maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
