<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will constantly be the odd issue that occasionally turns up. When you do discover your furnace acting strangely, it is really crucial that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as soon as possible.

<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial structures, apartment buildings and huge homes. Numerous steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, due to the fact that the lack of moving parts makes them less prone to tear and use. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
<h3>Electric Furnace in Twin Lake Michigan</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the see. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>

In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
