<p>Oil furnaces are generally not really efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not attain an efficiency higher than 90%. A few high-end brands have a performance of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more pricey, having starting expenses for the furnace itself at around $5,000.
