One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface area.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may also be required.<p>
<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke.
