<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the workers sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales guy concerns your home he exists to sell, that is the only way he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "need" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the options for your needs and you decide if you require it.<p>
