The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most cost effective if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature deterioration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.  a really advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
