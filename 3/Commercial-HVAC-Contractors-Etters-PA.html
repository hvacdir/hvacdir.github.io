My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
