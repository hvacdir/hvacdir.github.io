Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground.

<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be extreme. They consist of hold-ups in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Babies, fetuses, and kids are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups given that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive impacts of lead. Children might have greater exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
