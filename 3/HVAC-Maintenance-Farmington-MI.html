<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the abilities or tools necessary to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, but property owners do not have the essential equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still needed to have a professional technician check the system periodically.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as essential when it pertains to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, however will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to effectively cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a brand-new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
