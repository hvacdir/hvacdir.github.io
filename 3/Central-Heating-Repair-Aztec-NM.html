<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Aztec NM?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Stability Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 furnaces were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced 2 heaters and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday till the brand-new heaters can heat your house. Honestly, our house heater is complicated, Rob and his group repaired the old duct, changed all the dampers, make the entire system work perfectly.<p>
<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
