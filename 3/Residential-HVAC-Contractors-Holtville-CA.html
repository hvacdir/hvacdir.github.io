<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Holtville CA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
