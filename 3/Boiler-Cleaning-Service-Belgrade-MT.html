<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor carefully, a lot of the 'reliable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. These products present a risk just when they are dealt with in a way that produces dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or interrupted by repair, renovating, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being air-borne if correct controls are not in place. This can lead to the capacity for considerable health issue.<p>
