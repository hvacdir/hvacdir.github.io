<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Open windows or utilize exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common technique of decreasing direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will decrease but not eliminate exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that smoking cigarettes produces such large quantities of toxins, natural or mechanical ventilation techniques do not eliminate them from the air in your house as quickly as they develop. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it takes to significantly reduce direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can likewise increase energy costs significantly. Subsequently, the most reliable way to reduce direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to remove smoking cigarettes there.<p>
