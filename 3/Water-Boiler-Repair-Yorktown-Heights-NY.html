It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with newcomers more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle homeowners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>

<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Think about an entire home dehumidifier if your single phase air conditioner isn't old enough to justify replacement. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single stage system, you can enjoy a few of the benefits of a variable speed compressor without replacing any equipment.
