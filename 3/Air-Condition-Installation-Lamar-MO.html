<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My eldest child always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The noise level is itâ and low $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
