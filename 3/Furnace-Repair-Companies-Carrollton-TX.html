According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same toxins. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>

<p>A/c and refrigeration are provided through the elimination of heat. Heat can be removed through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are described as refrigerants A refrigerant is employed either in a heatpump system in which a compressor is used to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a free cooling system which utilizes pumps to flow a cool refrigerant (normally water or a glycol mix).<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
