To save energy and money, you must shop an energy-efficient air conditioner and minimize your central air conditioner's energy use.

<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is upgraded every 4 years. The Principles Handbook consists of heating and cooling estimations. The design expert must speak with ASHRAE data for the standards of design and care as the typical building codes offer little to no details on HVAC style practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do consist of much detail on installation requirements, however.

<p>Air conditioning system can create a great deal of water due to the fact that they eliminate wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have an usually plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see Air Conditioner Leaks Water, below.<p>

<p>The icing issue ends up being a lot more severe with lower outside temperature levels, so heat pumps are typically installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
