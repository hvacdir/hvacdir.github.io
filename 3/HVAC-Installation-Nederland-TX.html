<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of individuals who reside in the house. Pollutants might come from outside the home-- such as an idling vehicle engine in a connected garage, yard trash burning, or radon entering your home from the ground below. An air pollutant might likewise come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care products. Bacteria and infections, pet dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Typically the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to minimize their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the quantity of emissions. In a lot of cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
