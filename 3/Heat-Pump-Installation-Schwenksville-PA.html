<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are frequently 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, oil or electrical energy to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in private spaces. All-electric boilers can attain as much as 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Schwenksville PA 19473</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Before you head out and buy an a/c unit, there are a few things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the ac system? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How large should the air conditioning unit be? Too big and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioner and reduce its life. Too little and your a/c will not be able to cool your home correctly. When shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are simply a few of the factors that you need to take into account. Each option can and will considerably impact your system's performance, which is why you can't pay for to overlook any of them.<p>
