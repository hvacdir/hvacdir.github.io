<p>Filters can get filthy easily, particularly if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, debris, germs, and tidy the air. They're responsible for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed routinely, your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.

There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical element essential in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
