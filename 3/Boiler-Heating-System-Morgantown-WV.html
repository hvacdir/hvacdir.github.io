<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
