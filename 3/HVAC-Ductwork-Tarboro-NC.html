<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw.
