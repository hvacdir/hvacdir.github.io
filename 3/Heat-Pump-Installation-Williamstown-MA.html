<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and filthy. The old coolant will adversely affect the system's performance. To make certain the system is working successfully, think about having a routine coolant system flush. A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your car's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or check out Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly may end up being clogged up, decreasing air flow distribution, volume, and quality.

Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also should be appropriately maintained to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
