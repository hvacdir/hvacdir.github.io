<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate great however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
