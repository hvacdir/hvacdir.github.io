Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
