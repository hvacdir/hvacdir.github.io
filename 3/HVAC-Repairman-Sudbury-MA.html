An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water.

A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
