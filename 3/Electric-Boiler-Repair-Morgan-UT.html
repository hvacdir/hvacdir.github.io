<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
