<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
