<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, controlling the power to the heating wires and also managing the temperature of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. Nevertheless, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unobstructed.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This normally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your home escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>

The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
