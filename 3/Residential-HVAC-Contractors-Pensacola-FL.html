<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not have the ability to appropriately cool the house on hot days.
