<p>Chemical pollutants: Unpredictable organic substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are various, varied, and ubiquitous.

<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may notice moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, talk with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the home.<p>
