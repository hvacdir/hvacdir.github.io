Luis was the 6th individual, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern. He is sincere, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
