<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
