<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Woodstown NJ 08098</h3>
<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Due to the fact that it exhausts warm air out the top, don't put the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any airflow restriction will reduce the unit's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
