<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your home. Heatpump operate on electricity and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
