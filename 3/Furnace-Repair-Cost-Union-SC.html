<p>All Points Heating uses home cooling, air conditioner installation, air conditioning unit maintenance that deliver trusted, proven performance at high performance. Combustion products from vehicle exhaust, heating systems, water heaters, space heaters, aromatic candles, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not properly vented can generate carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates.
