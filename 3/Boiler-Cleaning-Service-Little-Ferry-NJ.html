<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Central Heating Installation Agency in Little Ferry NJ</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were extremely pleased that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter. We want we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut down the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
