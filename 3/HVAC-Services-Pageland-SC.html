<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we suggest utilizing our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you money when utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very efficient thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
<p>Filters can get dirty easily, specifically if you reside in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, bacteria, and tidy the air.
