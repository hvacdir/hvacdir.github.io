<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Cleveland OK</h3>
<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence has indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outside air in even the biggest and most industrialized cities. Other research study indicates that people spend roughly 90 percent of their time indoors. Thus, for lots of people, the risks to health may be higher due to direct exposure to air pollution inside your home than outdoors.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things first. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
