One is hydronic where water or a particular fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the flooring surface. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are required to withstand existing, which then produces heat.<p>
<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and lastly loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being dirty and old.
