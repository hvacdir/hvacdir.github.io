<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might suck up to two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed just a couple of years ago.<p>

<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor guidelines based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor devices through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Use professionals and treat them well: Motivated, well-compensated experts perform better work than transient subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success. An ethical company doesn't make use of inexpensive labor chances even if they're cheap. Affordable workmanship is generally substandard craftsmanship, and it never helps a company develop long-lasting relationships with clients.<p>
