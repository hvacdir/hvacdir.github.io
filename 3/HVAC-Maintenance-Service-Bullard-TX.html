<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near to your home as possible per my demand.

Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)
