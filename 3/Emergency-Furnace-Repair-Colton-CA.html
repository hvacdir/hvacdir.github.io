<p>Chemical toxins: Volatile organic compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; furnishings, wall and floor coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer products) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
