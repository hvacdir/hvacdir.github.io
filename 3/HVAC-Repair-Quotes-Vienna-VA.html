<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
