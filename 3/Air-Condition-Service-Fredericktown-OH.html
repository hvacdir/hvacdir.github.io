<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years earlier and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year.
