<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the quantity of outside air coming indoors. A lot of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outside ventilation rate.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
