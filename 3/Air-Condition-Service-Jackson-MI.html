<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues.

Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
