<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Yadkinville NC</h3>
<p>When you and your family walk into your home in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfortable as you can be?

<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
