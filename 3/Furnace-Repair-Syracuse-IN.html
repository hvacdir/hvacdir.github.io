<h3>Assessing the Efficiency of Your HVAC System at Syracuse IN</h3>

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
