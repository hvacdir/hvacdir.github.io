When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
