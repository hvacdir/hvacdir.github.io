<p>Another alternative to oil furnaces are gas furnaces While oil is generally used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you might have a choice in between the two types. Gas heating systems cost about the same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The genuine benefit of utilizing a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home.

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your automobile. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter better traps pollutants and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
