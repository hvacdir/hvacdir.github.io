<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor allergens or have respiratory issues, winter can exacerbate issues.

In late winter and early spring, it might still be too chilly to throw open the windows to pull out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it's important to be knowledgeable about a few of the allergy and breathing triggers that might be prowling in your surroundings.<p>
