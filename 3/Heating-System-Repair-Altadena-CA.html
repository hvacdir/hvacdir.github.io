<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Advice For Altadena CA Home Owners</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heater require relatively little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is important to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of standard water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank must be checked for leakages, the system should be flushed occasionally to remove tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems need to be examined a minimum of twice each year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to eliminate dust collected in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
