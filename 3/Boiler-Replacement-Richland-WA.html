<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. Another element of the task is recommending customers as to how to avoid future problems and correctly preserve equipment by, for instance, frequently oiling parts or changing filters.

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
