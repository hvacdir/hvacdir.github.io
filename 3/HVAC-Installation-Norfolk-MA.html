<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everyone can pay for, numerous Seattleites must find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as soon as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the country to face the truth of a terrible, vicious summer.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
