<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Marietta GA</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
