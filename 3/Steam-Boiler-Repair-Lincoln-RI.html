<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Companies in Lincoln</h2>

<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for assessment and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
