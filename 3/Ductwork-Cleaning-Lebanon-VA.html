<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
