<h3>Indoor Air Conditioner in Ketchikan AK 99901</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit sincere, responsive and enjoyable. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing professional discussed our alternatives prior to our work with Brian and was incredible, helpful and useful - his work was impeccable! All of his assistants were diligent and polite. The work website was left entirely cleared and cleaned up. We would highly encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and A/c for all their heating and cooling requirements.<p>
