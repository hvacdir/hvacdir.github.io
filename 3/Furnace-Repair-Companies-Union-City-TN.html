<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release pollutants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
