<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
