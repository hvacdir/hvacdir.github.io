<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be residing in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and cooling system.

But many of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne impurities in their homes and intensify asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The EPA suggests that you have your duct examined by a professional heating and cooling contractor. If your technician finds that your duct have substantial mold, dust, dirt, and other contaminants or a musty odor, they might recommend duct cleaning This is especially important if someone in your household has asthma, allergies, or other symptoms that may be associated with indoor air pollution.<p>

Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.
