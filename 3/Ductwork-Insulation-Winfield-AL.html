However, direct exposure to hazardous levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible in many cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at significant levels in the released spores. The primary threat of mold growth, as it relates to indoor air quality, originates from the allergenic properties of the spore cell wall. More major than many allergenic homes is the ability of mold to set off episodes in persons that currently have asthma, a severe respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality professionals can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To decrease pollutants, we recommend installing sophisticated air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are created to remove the smallest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sanitation systems also assist control germs and organic smells. Most store-bought filters can not remove these tiniest of irritants and do not eliminate gases and bacteria.<p>
