Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
