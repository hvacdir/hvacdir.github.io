<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Waco Texas</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the property.<p>

For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the higher temperatures in some cases used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to supply thermal convenience indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors.

<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outside) air to water down contaminated (indoor) air.

Momentarily increasing ventilation paired with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in watering down the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
