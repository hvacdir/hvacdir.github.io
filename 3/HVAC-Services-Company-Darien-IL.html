<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
