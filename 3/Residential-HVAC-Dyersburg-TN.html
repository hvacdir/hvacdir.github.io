<p>Second, recognition of pollutant sources is typically important to determining the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such info can in some cases be acquired by requesting copies of air tracking data from the company. If monitoring data is not offered, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent must request that the company have air tracking tests performed. Review of this data might recognize possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant employee health signs. However, when impurity concentrations are very low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
