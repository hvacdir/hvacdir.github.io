Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
