<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one response stated the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented.
