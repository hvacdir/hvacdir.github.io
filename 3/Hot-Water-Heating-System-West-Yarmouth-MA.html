<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The firm started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, up until the mandate for high-efficiency units required Goettl to end production. The contracting side of business continued under a number of owners. Goodrich's father was a Goettl dealership in Las Vegas, so when the chance came to purchase what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>

<p>It's not advised for uncertified people to repair & inspect cooling & HVAC devices. There is a threat of electric shock & death if not correctly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
