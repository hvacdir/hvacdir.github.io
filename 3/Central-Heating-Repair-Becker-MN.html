<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
