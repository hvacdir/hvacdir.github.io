Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your home. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing.
