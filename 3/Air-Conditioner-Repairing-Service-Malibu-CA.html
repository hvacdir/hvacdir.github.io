<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All items in the hot zone reach balance in temperature level after the convected heat system has been running for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

A professional technician will check the thermostat during the annual maintenance to guarantee the actual temperature and the temperature on the thermostat matches. The technician needs to check the thermostat's efficiency or evaluate the entire HVAC system if there's a distinction in the temperature level.<p>
