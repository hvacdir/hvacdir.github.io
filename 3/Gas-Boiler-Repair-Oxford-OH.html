<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
