<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product with time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
