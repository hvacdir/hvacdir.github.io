<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
