<p>A third way to decide whether your house might have bad indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, look for signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can indicate your house might not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on walls or windows, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being moldy. To detect odors in your house, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are visible.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
