<p>The main reason house owners do not acquire an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the amount of services offered. If the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's warranty, the cost might not be rewarding. Any major repairs need to be covered under the producer's service warranty.

<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which results in the supply and elimination of air from inside a building."

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
