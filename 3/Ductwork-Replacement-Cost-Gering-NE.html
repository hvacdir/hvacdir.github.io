<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in collecting details on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.
