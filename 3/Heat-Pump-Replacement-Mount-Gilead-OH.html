<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own homes and my realty clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is truthful, trustworthy, and affordable on cost. It's tough to discover an honest AC guy and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to discover how to get the water checked. Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for additional information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can pay for, so many Seattleites need to discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in response to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a cruel, vicious summertime.<p>
<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant got here on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
