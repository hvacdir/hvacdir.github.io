<p>The first air conditioning system and refrigerators used toxic or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that could lead to fatal mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<h3>How Do Air Heat Pump Works at Santa Clarita CA?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
