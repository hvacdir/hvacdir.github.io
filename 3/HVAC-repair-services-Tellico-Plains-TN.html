<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and offices matters, especially given that we spend the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning unit assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in extremely humid climates or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your house.

<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.

When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Oil furnaces are generally not very efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but most do not accomplish an effectiveness higher than 90%. A few high-end brand names have an efficiency of 95% by using a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000.
