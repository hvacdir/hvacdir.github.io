<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
