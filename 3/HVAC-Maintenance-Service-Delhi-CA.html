<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor office, class or laboratory environments, as opposed to outside or commercial settings.

The marketing portion of your company prepare for an HVAC company need to consist of how you'll market these types of services.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also intensify indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system might be contaminated (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread these toxins throughout the house. Second, the HVAC duct distribution system can spread toxins from one part of the house to another. Routine maintenance and duct sealing can help reduce these issues.<p>

<p>Research study credible construction and improvement firms in your area and deal to be a reliable HVAC resource.
