<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
