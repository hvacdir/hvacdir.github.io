For example, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, resulting in holes and cracks. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and safeguards the part.  a really advantageous result and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
