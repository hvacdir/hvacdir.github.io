Throughout the 1970s, lots of property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
