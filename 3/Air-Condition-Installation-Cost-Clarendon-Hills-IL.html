<h3>Different types of HVAC Repairs in Clarendon Hills IL</h3>
<p>One of the main factors a furnace will run continuously is because something is unclean or stopped up Before attempting to repair any problem, take time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Check the furnace blower for obstructing and tidy it if the air filter is excellent to go. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it. If you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running, contact an experienced technician.<p>
<p>Check these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the lowered air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
