<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your home will not warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
<h3>Home Air Conditioning Company in Morehead Kentucky</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
<p>People have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint due to the fact that these activities produce large amounts of lead dust. Consult your state health or real estate department for tips on which private laboratories or public firms might have the ability to assist test your house for lead in paint.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
