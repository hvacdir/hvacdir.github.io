<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
