Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
