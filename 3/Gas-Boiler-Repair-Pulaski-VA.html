<p>I have been using them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies quoted me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is honest, dependable, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to discover an honest AC guy and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
