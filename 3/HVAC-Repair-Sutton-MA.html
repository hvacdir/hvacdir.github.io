<p>A customized a/c unit that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system because both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. Due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, given that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is in fact heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
