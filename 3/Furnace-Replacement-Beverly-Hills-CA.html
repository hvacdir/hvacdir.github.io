<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, most Midtown Houston Tx customers don't understand why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's most likely your issue. The next step is to thaw your air conditioning equipment if you found that your conditioning filter requires changing. The most convenient method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

This can lead to the potential for significant health issue.<p>
