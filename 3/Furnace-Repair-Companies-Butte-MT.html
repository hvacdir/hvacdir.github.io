<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown.

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Butte MT</h3>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
