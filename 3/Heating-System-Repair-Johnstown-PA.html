<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
