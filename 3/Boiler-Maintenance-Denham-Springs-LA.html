When they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply, glowing heat systems have been around considering that the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and an elementary pumping device to flow hot water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the harmony of the flooring heat moved heat to other articles in the spaces, consisting of the human residents.<p>

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
