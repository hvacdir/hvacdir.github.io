<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, given that it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines remove the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however many use the general rule that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is probably a much better solution. If the existing system has not sustained other major repairs, remains in otherwise exceptional condition, and issues that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and treated, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the US your home lies, the local region's environment can change drastically. A home situated in the South would require an AC unit with a size efficient in cooling your home due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the US would require a much bigger heating capacity as well which will affect costs. See the chart below for the average central air conditioning conditioner replacement expenses by LOTS.<p>
