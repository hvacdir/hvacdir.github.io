Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone. Similar to measuring the size of a system required based on BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of system for your house also depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
