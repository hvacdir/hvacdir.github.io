<p>Whatever heating unit you set up, it's essential that it's sized correctly for your house. Too large and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will use too much energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced.

<p>A lot of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
