<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements.
