<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heatpump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a home heating unit, you might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and performance. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to try to find a model that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winters.

The radiators may be mounted on walls or installed within the floor to produce flooring heat.<p>
