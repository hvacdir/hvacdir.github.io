<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide car debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, see Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
