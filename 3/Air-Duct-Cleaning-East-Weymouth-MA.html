<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
