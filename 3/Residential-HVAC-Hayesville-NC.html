It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.
