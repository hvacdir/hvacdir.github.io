<p>Choosing the right size ac system is a vital part of the HVAC buying procedure and one that you'll need an HVAC professional to help you with. Here's why purchasing the ideal size ac system matters: if you purchase an HVAC system that's too big, you'll wind up wasting cash and energy. And if it's too small, you will not get enough cool or warm air to keep you comfy.<p>
<p>You might upgrade to the highest performance equipment offered and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are only part of the central air system. The average home's ductwork leakages 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower systems, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring how much air escapes the system.<p>
