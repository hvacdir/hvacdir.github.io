<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might choose to change the outside compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system.
