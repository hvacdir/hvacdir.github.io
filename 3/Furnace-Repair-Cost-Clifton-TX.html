The most reliable fans are peaceful and resilient. Usage fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans geared up with timers or de-humidistat controls work to guarantee the fans run for an adequate amount of time. An excellent guideline is to run a restroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
