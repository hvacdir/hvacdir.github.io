They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
