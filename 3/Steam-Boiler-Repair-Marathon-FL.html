<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in gathering information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but numerous utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is most likely a better solution.

<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high sufficient temperature level, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
