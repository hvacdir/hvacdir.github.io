<p>My oldest kid constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
