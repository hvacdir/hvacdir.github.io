<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your San Francisco CA Home</h3>
<p>Ductless a/c is, of course, perfect for houses without ducts, however is likewise a flexible option for a range of other situations.

Extremely economical, and energy-efficient, and supplying higher control over when and where the air goes in your home, All Points Heating can assist you pick the very best ductless air conditioning system for your requirements.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
