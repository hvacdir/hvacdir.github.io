<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in delay functions when they're shut down and then repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you want to get those capacitors altered to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
