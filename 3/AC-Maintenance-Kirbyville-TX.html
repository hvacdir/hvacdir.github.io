<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for many years.

You can probably expect to cut your fuel bills in half if your heating system is 25 years old or more.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating elements set up in the subfloor of each space in the house, sometimes linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the technique is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
