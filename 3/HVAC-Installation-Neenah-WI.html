We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding.
