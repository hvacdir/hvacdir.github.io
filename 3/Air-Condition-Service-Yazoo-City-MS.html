<p>Ensure there are no carpets, furniture, or anything else limiting the flow of air. Not only will obstructed vents and signs up affect your convenience, they can also lead to duct leaks due to extreme air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and signs up in unused spaces is NOT an excellent idea. You won't save any additional money and will wind up triggering more problems for your heating unit.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to turn on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Prior to that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
