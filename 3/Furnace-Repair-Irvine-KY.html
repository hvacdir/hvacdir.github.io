(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI safeguarded.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
