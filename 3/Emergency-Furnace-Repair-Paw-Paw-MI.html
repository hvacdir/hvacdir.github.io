<p>Correct ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic.

Simply put, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heatpump work on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>For contaminants besides radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health signs or indications of poor ventilation and specific sources or toxins have been determined as possible causes of indoor air quality issues.

<p>Homeowners might likewise assume that due to the fact that a glowing flooring heating system can be viewed (and financed) as a house improvement, its installation will instantly raise their house's value. No proof exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or negatively impacts home values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Value Report issued by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Magazine.
