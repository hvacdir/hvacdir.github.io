<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Before you go out and buy an ac system, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning system? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How large should the a/c unit be? Too large and you'll run into problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioner and reduce its life. Too little and your ac system won't be able to cool your house appropriately. These are just a few of the elements that you require to consider when buying a brand-new AC system. Each choice can and will considerably affect your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to disregard any of them.<p>
<p>Aside from area heating, the geothermal heating unit can also be linked to a gadget called a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat produced from the ground source heatpump compressor and uses it to heat water. This suggests that this gadget can also supply free hot water for domestic use in addition to its conventional geothermal heating and cooling function.<p>
