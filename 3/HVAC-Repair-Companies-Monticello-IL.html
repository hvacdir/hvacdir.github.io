Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not require.<p>
