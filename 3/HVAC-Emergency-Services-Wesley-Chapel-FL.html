<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Wesley Chapel FL</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house construction is to lower air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, roofings, and floorings. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>
