<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is typically higher than many heat pump alternatives, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the design you purchase. One of the main advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to higher temperature levels than other heating alternatives. This suggests it can heat up your home to the wanted temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heater appears less like a luxury product and more like a need. (Besides, heated up floors were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) However before you dedicate to what can be a significant improvement job, it's finest to ask yourself whether a glowing floor heating system is a proper service for your particular house heating requirements.<p>
