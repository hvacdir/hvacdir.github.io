A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter when every 3 months. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

<p>Because an a/c moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
