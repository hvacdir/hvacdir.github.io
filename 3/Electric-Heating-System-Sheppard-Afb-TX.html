<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor sensibly, many of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed homeowners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same).
