<h3>Heat Pump Maintenance and Tune-Ups in Keystone Heights FL 32656</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
