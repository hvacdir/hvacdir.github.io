<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful direct exposures to lead can be produced when lead-based paint is poorly removed from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in houses can also arise from lead dust from outside sources, consisting of infected soil tracked inside, and usage of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>We have actually been incredibly delighted with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished annual maintenance of our system).

Temperature levels must range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by too much air circulation should be prevented. Maintenance of correct temperatures and humidity levels and appropriate air blood circulation will help to decrease the event of upper breathing symptoms, and, potentially, skin rashes.<p>

<p>A 3rd method to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, search for indications of issues with the ventilation in your house. Indications that can indicate your house might not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, smelly or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty. To find smells in your home, step outside for a couple of minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether smells are noticeable.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the area. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
