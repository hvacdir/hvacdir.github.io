<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning system moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both must be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
