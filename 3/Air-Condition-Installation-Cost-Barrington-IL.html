<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms.

However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
