<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. When the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into full operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly harden and treat-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
