<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in San Luis AZ?</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current trend in home building and construction is to decrease air leak through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofs. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and waters down indoor contaminants exhaust them from the home.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by certified HVAC professionals. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by numerous individuals.<p>
