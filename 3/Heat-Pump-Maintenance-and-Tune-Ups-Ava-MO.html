<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was extremely helpful in collecting details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and offered clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>

Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and cure-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
