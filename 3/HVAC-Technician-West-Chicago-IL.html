<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me regarding an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had called the service manager and left a message of issue.

Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
