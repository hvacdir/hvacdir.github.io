<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>When we remodel or add on a room, we often install small integrated electric space heating systems. Unlike heatpump, these units are self-contained. They are likewise safe compared to older-style electric baseboard heaters. They come in several forms: wall-mounted units that are excellent for little spaces like bathrooms, cove heating units that resemble baseboard heaters but are tucked safely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted convected heat panels that supply a mild sunshine-like warmth from above.<p>
