<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
