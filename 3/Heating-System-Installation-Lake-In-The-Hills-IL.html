<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't provide agreements.  The so called credible companies swindle more people than the fly by night clothing. Since I tried to work for them, I know. Since 90% of them are crooks, I quit. They walk in with or without a contract and start offering you things you don't require. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as a specialist to validate the so called treatments and problems. 9 out of 10, I inspect are completely wrong.<p>
<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a service was for monetary freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it took to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
