<p>Most people are aware that outside air pollution can impact their health, however indoor air pollution can also have substantial, harmful effect. EPA research studies of human direct exposure to air pollutants show that indoor levels of toxins may be two to five times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air pollution amongst the top five ecological health threats to the public.<p>
<p>Many factors impact IAQ. These aspects consist of bad ventilation (lack of outside air), issues managing temperature, high or low humidity, recent remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering into the building. Often, specific contaminants like dust from building and construction or restoration, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals released as a gas gradually) might trigger poor IAQ.<p>
