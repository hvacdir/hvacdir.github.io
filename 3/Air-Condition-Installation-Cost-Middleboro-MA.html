<p>It's not immediately clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a large retailer who asked not to be named due to the fact that he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a team that regularly monitors energy usage and temperature levels in stores to minimize costs (especially during the night) and to alert store supervisors if temperatures in the shops vary beyond an acceptable variety that might prevent customers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more cost-effective method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your home are noted later on in this area.<p>
