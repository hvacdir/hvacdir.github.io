Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex effectively recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install examination results look very good for braising and pipes quality.
