<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
