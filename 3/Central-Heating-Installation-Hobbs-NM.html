<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his examination, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
