<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your ac system is low on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leakages, simply including refrigerant is not a solution.

Remember that the performance and performance of your a/c is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be hazardous to the environment.<p>

If you currently have a house heater, you may search for a heatpump more tailored toward cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to look for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winters.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may get in nearby ventilation intakes. Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outdoor fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
