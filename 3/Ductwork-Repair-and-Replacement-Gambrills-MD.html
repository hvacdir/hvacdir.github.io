<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER rating of a system is the cooling output at differing temperature levels during the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the very same period. Essentially, SEER provides more information based upon how the EER performs in various temperatures. The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>
