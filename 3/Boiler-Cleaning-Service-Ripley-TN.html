<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
