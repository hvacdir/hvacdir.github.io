<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Company in Mountain Top</h2>

<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leaks, simply adding refrigerant is not a solution. An experienced technician should fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and effectiveness of your air conditioning system is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
