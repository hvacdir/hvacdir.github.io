<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Installation in Dobbs Ferry New York</h3>
<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't use agreements.  The so called trustworthy companies dupe more individuals than the fly by night clothing. Due to the fact that I tried to work for them, I know. I give up since 90% of them are scoundrels. They walk in with or without a contract and start selling you things you do not require. They lie. How do I know. I now work as an expert to verify the so called problems and remedies. 9 out of 10, I check are completely incorrect.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed simply a few years ago.<p>
