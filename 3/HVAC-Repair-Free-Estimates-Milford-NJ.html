<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is frequently crucial to determining the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such info can often be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If keeping track of data is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union agent should ask for that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this data might identify possibly hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, monitoring data might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
