<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon becomes a concern when radon becomes trapped in structures and concentrations construct up inside.<p>

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide should be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be needed.<p>
<p>Normally the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more affordable technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
