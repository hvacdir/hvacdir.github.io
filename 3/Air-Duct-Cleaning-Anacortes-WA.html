<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, classroom or laboratory environments, as opposed to outdoor or commercial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It might likewise consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
<p>The very first air conditioning unit and fridges used flammable or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might lead to fatal accidents when they dripped.

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant.
