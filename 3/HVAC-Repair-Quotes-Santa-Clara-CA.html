<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Santa Clara CA?</h3>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and likewise managing the temperature of the floor. All wiring for your radiant heat system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators. This normally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides heat from the floor up throughout the room with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>

<p>The predominant health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might position risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
