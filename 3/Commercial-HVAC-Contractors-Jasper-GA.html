<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
