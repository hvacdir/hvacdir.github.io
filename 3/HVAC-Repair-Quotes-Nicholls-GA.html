<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

And almost 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can intensify indoor air quality.<p>
