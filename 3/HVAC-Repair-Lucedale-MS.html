<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical functions of eco-friendly homes as part of the growing green structure movement. Green projects represented 20 percent of all recently developed houses in the U.S. in 2015. By 2016, a Wall Street Journal short article anticipated that green housing will grow from $36 billion a year to as much as $114 billion. That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole real estate market.<p>

<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>
