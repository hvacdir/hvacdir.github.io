<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little.

The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
