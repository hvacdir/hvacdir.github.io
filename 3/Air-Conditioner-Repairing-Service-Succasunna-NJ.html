<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
