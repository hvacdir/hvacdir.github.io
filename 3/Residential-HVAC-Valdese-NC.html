<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (in many cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
