<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They include hold-ups in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, kids, and fetuses are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups since lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more conscious the harmful impacts of lead.

Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, since all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
