<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC market, Bard Production combines quality products and outstanding service with development and technological advances to deliver high-performance heating and cooling products all over the world. A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into 2 parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of a number of spaces with one external system. In the outside system of this ac system there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting numerous traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor systems found in the space.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark went out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
