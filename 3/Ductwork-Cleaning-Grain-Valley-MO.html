<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company utilized 98% of the existing material purchased with the house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes.

As a brand-new resident I have discovered how to identify the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
