<p>Selecting the right size a/c is a crucial part of the HVAC buying process and one that you'll require an HVAC expert to assist you with. Here's why buying the ideal size a/c matters: if you buy an HVAC system that's too huge, you'll end up losing cash and energy. And if it's too small, you won't get warm or enough cool air to keep you comfy.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as important as a routine oil change in your automobile. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high usage months, examine the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
