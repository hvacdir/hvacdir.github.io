<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
