<p>A customized a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a standard a/c in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air course. A standard a/c transfers heat out of the space since its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
