After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
