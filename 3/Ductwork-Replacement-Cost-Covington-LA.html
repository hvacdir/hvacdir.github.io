<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
