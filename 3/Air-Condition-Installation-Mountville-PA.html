<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Mountville PA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really happy that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioner before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to check AC systems even in winter season. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Make sure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
