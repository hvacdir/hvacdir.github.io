<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct.
