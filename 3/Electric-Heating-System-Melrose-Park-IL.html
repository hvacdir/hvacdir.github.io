Local restroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants directly from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a tube two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the registers at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
