<p>Individuals working in buildings with poor IAQ may discover unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak with your medical professional about them. But not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>

Molekule, a residential air purifier start-up, introduced a new item, now for health care usage, and got a FDA 510( k) Class II Medical Gadget Clearance.<p>
