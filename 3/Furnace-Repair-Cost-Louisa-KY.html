Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up features when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually subscribed to an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
