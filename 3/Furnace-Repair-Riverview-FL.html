<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
