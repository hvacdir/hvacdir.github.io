<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi annual maintenance today. Trace was on time, polite, and respected my home by constantly using boot coverings when entering my house. He showed the points of evaluation and likewise recommended I have a UV light set up due to a small buildup of mold accumulating in the air handler, which he completely examined and cleaned the exterior compressor coils along with ensured the moisture discharge tube was clear by utilizing a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He also removed the leaves that built up inside the interior of the compressor unit and suggested an option to prevent it from continuing, which will do.I received a detailed e-mail report of the inspection detailing all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a possession to Waychoff's and I extremely recommend him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have very high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your vehicle. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. As soon as every three months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. Throughout high use months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
