<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
