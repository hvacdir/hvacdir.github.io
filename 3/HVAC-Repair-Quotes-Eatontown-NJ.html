<p>Some biological pollutants activate allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Transmittable health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are sent through the air. Molds and mildews launch disease-causing toxins.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, see Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
