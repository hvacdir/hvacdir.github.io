<p>Many central air conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works but your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
