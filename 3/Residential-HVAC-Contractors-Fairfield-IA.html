<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
