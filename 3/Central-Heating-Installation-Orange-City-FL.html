Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>

However, both systems have a large range of various components for different applications as well as a variety of brand and specific installation requirements.
