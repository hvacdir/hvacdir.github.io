<p>New heating systems are significantly more effective than those of 10 or more years back, cutting costs by as much as 30%. To get long-lasting and repair-free performance from your brand-new system, proper installation is a necessity.

Even if the opening is little, air will move up until the within pressure amounts to the exterior.<p>

<p>When mounting a wall sensor, think about the height at which they must be put. Many commonly they are mounted at height-level or slightly lower, if individuals mostly remain seated in that particular area.

<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should also be taken to minimize pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, citizens need to be alert to the emergence of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization procedures must not be carried out until these problems have actually been corrected.<p>
