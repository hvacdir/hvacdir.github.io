<p>Aside from area heating, the geothermal heater can likewise be linked to a gadget referred to as a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat generated from the ground source heat pump compressor and utilizes it to heat water.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
