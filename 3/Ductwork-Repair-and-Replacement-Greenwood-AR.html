<h3>How To Soundproof a Central Heating System in Greenwood AR</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing trend in house construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in floors, walls, and roofing systems.

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants exhaust them from the house.<p>
