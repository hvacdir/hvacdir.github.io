<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
