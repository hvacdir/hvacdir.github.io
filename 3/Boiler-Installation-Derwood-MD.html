<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators.

Radiant heat offers heat from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>

The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct, supplying warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
