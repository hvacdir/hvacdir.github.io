<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, given that the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not simple, considering that it considers not just the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have an issue as long as your house still warms to the best temperature. The temperature level of the air produced by the heatpump will not necessarily be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it may not feel extremely hot. Just be concerned if your house is not heating up. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice.
