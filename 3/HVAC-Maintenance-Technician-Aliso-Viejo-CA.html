<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is likewise more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite significant.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
