As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
