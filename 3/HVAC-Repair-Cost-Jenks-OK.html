<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, given that it is secured inside your home. When it does require to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in a whole brand-new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever.
