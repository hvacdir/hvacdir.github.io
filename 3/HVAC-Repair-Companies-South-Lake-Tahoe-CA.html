<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<h3>Ductwork Installation in South Lake Tahoe CA 96150</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for many years for my services, my own homes and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who described to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again. He is truthful, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's tough to find an honest AC guy and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>When you buy a new heating & cooling system, you're investing in your house, your family, and your company. You deserve to know who will show up, how they will look, and have confidence in the company you've worked with. We hear all the time about sketchy automobiles showing up with individuals who can't interact well, aren't expert, and leaves you wondering what you simply invested your money on.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but lots of use the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better service. If the existing system has not incurred other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be determined and fixed, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
<p>No matter the type of electric glowing floor heater, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or altered. Any disturbance or interruption in the circulation of electrical power makes the system inoperable. This is one of the downsides to installing an electric convected heat system. Nevertheless, assuming they are installed correctly and properly looked after, the possibility of them having issues is small.<p>
