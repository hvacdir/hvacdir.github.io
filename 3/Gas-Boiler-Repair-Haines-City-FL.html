<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is upgraded every 4 years. The Basics Handbook consists of heating and cooling calculations. The design professional must consult ASHRAE information for the requirements of design and care as the common building codes provide little to no information on HVAC design practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do consist of much information on installation requirements, however.

<p>Many central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the ac system works however your home does not cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
