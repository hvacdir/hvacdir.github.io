Most common are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements set up in the subfloor of each room in the home, occasionally linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house.
