<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of concern. Ron had spotted the problem area in looking over the expense. He dealt with the problem in one day, had adjusted the expense to what I considered reasonable prior to he recalled, knew what may have triggered the issue and had a strategy to insure that it would not happen again. I have thought about All Points a company with stability for the 9 years we have used them. This experience confirms that.<p>
