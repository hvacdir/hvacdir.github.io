While pollutants commonly found in indoor air can trigger lots of hazardous impacts, there is significant uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are necessary to produce particular illness.

<p>The very first a/c unit and refrigerators employed hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or lp, that could lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
