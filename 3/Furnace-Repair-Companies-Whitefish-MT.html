<p>The reality is, air pollution in your house can be simply as bad - or even worse - than it is outdoors. And with the average American spending 87% of their life indoors, you 'd believe that indoor air quality would be something we 'd find out about more frequently. But don't worry! With a little preventative maintenance and some fundamental understanding, you can take immediate steps to improve your indoor air quality today.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in structure are determined by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural impacts. Air pressure differences developed by these forces move airborne contaminants from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any available opening in structure walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move until the within pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>Outside pollutants. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems efficiently filters particulates. Professionals recommend utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and typically are more appropriate for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>

<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Whitefish MT</h3>

The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air waters down indoor contaminants and assists exhaust them from the house.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everybody can pay for, so many Seattleites should find methods to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in big box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a terrible, vicious summer season.<p>
