<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and experienced. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
