We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
