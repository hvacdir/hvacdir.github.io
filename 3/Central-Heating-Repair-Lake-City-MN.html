<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Lake City MN Home Owners</h3>
<p>Another technique to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Many home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening windows and doors, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window a/c with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
