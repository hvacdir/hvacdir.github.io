<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things first. Make certain all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up.

Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it.
