The state of California has the authority to manage indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
