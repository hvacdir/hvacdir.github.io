<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
