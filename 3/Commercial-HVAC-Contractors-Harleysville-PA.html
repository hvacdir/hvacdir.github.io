PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space.
