<h3>Ductless AC System in Wilmington NC 28403</h3>
<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor home appliances through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is a chance to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them till they have actually been appropriately dried. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
