<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos items consist of vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement products. When they are handled in a method that develops dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be breathed in, these products present a risk only. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or interrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, tiny fibers can end up being air-borne if proper controls are not in place. This can lead to the potential for substantial health problems.<p>
