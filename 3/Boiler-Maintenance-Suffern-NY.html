<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
