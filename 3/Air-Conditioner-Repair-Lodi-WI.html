<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
