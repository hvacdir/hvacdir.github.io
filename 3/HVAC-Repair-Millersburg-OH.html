<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works however the house does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
