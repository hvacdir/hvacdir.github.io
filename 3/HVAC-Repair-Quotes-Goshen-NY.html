<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and hence needs conditions appropriate for both organisms. The germs forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, including chlorine. Remediation for Legionella break outs in commercial structures differ, but typically consist of extremely hot water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in many cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive procedures consist of changing regular hot water levels to permit 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, evaluating facility design layout, getting rid of faucet aerators, and regular screening in suspect areas.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high use months, check the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
