<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your house at maximum effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot house will require a much larger AC unit than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no cracks for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfortable. Other factors that can affect this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas gets in houses through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains pipes, and sumps. Direct exposure to radon becomes an issue when radon becomes trapped in buildings and concentrations construct up inside your home.<p>
