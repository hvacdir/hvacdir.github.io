<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heating systems have multiple control boards. The biggest, or only one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards coordinate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the brand-new control board must be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
