<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
