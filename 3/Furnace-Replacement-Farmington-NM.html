<p>This in floor heater includes one thin constant cable heating component woven into a mat that you set up under the tile. These heated floors are a task best done when overhauling or altering the floor covering of an existing room or when adding a brand-new space. Heated flooring can be installed as extra heat to take the relax of the flooring or as area heat to warm the entire restroom. Heated floor covering is also a fantastic project for warming entranceway and kitchen area floors.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the same.
