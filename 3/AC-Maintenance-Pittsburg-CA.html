<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Its unique feature is the existence of one primary external unit that linked to a number of indoor systems.

The main external system can be linked to several various indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, and so on<p>
