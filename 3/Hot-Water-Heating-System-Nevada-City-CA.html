<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
