<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
