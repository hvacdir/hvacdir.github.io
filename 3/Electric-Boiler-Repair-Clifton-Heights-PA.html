Such aspects consist of making use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furnishings; carbon monoxide produced by cigarette smoke and outdoors traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls consisted of in electrical transformers; radiation from constructing insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, photo copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
