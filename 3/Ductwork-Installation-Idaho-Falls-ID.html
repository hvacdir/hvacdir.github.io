<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than equipment installed simply a couple of years back.<p>
