<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, but a homeowner does not have the tools or skills needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however house owners lack the essential devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still required to have a professional technician check the system regularly.<p>
