<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for consultation and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product.

Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions since they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Since a system is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy.
