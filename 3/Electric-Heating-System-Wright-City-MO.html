<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly might be because of a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air properly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>

<p>Outdoor pollutants. Outside particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a house. Particulates and allergens found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering inbound air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Professionals recommend utilizing filters with a MERV 6-8, however higher MERV levels trap smaller particles and usually are more appropriate for those with allergic reactions or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other irritants.<p>
