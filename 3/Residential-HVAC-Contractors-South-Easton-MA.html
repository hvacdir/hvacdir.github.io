<p>A packaged unit, normally installed on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is also a choice for homeowners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those looking to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system individually, considering that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally just available for larger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for property owners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
