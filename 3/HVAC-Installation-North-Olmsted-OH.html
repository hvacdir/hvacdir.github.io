<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
