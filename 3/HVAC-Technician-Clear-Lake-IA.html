<p>There are many actions a property owner can take to choose items that will prevent indoor air problems from happening - a couple of them are mentioned here. First, utilize exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, think about using strong wood items. Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make certain that an effective wetness barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it becomes damp.<p>
