<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually triggered by the lack of adequate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified inadequate ventilation as the main problem in over half the work environment indoor air examinations it has conducted. Examinations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the very same to be real. These examinations exposed that correct ventilation is necessary in maintaining great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
