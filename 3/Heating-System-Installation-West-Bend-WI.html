Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me preferential treatment, and want to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
