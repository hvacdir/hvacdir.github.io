<h3>What to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Burkburnett TX</h3>
<p>A split a/c system might cost near to that of a conventional HVAC system but has shown to be an alternative cost efficient option to homes that do not have ductwork. Used in addition to other kinds of heating or cooling, such as portable or window a/c, space heating units, or oil heating units, it can improve the comfort of your home while keeping your regular monthly utility costs reasonable.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
