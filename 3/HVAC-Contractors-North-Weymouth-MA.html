<h3>Repair and Care for North Weymouth MA Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>Before you choose a contractor, consider quotes from a minimum of 3 to 5 credible contractors. Consult your state's contractor's licensing board online to guarantee that no customer complaints have been filed and that the heating and air-conditioning contracting license is legitimate and active. Compare the various furnace performance ratings advised by the private contractors to select the design and system that best suits your energy needs. Keep in mind that energy-star ranked equipment will conserve you money in the end however might involve a greater up-front cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
