<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Bryson City NC</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in house construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floors. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater since the technicians thought they simply didn't appear right and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
