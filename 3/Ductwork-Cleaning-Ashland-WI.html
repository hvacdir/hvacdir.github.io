<p>Immediate discount rates on high-efficiency heatpump technologies are available to equipment installers, applied at the wholesaler or distributor point-of-purchase. Excellent Customer Service! Environment Pro is trusted and genuinely cared about us and our scenario. We got home one night to a cold home. I called Environment Pro, and Warren came by that very same night. Although he didn't have the needed replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might try to find and acquire it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely appreciative to have a heated home again. What's most amazing was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right prior to a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my buddies.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over twenty years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can inform you that it is a hard job that the employees sweat and bleed at, specifically residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with clients and keeps men working. When a sales guy comes to your home he is there to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and should not "need" to sell you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on. For me, I offer you the options for your needs and you choose if you need it.<p>

<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
