<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
