<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (revealed as a percentage efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic feet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends upon preserving it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
