<h3>Check Out Ductwork At Valatie NY Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating unit. We picked getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
